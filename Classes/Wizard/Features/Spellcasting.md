# Spellcasting

As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.

You prepare a list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. You learn spells as you gain levels, and you can replace prepared spells each day after a long rest.

Your spellcasting ability is Intelligence. You use your Intelligence modifier for spell save DC and spell attack bonus.
