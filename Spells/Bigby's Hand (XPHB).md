You create a Large hand of shimmering magical energy in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} equal to your {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB|Hit Point} maximum. If it drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, the spell ends. The hand doesn't occupy its space.

When you cast the spell and as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} on your later turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects:

**At Higher Levels.** The damage of the Clenched Fist increases by {@scaledamage 4d8|5-9|2d8} and the damage of the Grasping Hand increases by {@scaledamage 2d6|5-9|2d6} for each spell slot level above 5.
