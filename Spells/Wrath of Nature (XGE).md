You call out to the spirits of nature to rouse them against your enemies. Choose a point you can see within range. The spirits cause trees, rocks, and grasses in a 60-foot cube centered on that point to become animated until the spell ends.

### Grasses and Undergrowth

Any area of ground in the cube that is covered by grass or undergrowth is {@quickref difficult terrain||3} for your enemies.

### Trees

At the start of each of your turns, each of your enemies within 10 feet of any tree in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take {@damage 4d6} slashing damage from whipping branches.

### Roots and Vines

At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become {@condition restrained} until the spell ends. A {@condition restrained} creature can use an action to make a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Rocks

As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a loose rock in the cube to launch at a creature you can see in the cube. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 3d8} nonmagical bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall {@condition prone}.
