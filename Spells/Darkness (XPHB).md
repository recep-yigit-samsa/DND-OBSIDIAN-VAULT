# Darkness

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Darkness | 2 | Evocation | 60 ft. | Timed | - | - |

For the duration, magical {@variantrule Darkness|XPHB} spreads from a point within range and fills a 15-foot-radius Sphere. {@sense Darkvision|XPHB} can't see through it, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the {@variantrule Darkness|XPHB} to fill a 15-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the {@variantrule Darkness|XPHB}.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} or {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} created by a spell of level 2 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.
