| Sunburst | 8 | Evocation | 150 ft. | Instant | 12d6 radiant | - |

Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 12d6} radiant damage and is {@condition blinded} for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition blinded} by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

A creature {@condition blinded} by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer {@condition blinded}.

This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.
