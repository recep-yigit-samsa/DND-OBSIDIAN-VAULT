| Witch Bolt | 1 | Evocation | 60 ft. | Timed | 2d12 Lightning + 1d12 Lightning | - |

A beam of crackling energy lances toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against it. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 2d12} Lightning damage.

On each of your subsequent turns, you can take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to deal {@damage 1d12} Lightning damage to the target automatically, even if the first attack missed.

The spell ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has Total {@variantrule Cover|XPHB} from you.

**At Higher Levels.** The initial damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d12|1-9|1d12} for each spell slot level above 1.
