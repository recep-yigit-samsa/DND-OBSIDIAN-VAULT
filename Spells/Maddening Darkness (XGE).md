| Maddening Darkness | 8 | Evocation | 150 ft. | Timed | 8d8 psychic | - |

Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with {@sense darkvision} can't see through this darkness. Non-magical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can't illuminate the area.

Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking {@damage 8d8} psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
