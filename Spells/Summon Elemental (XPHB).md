You call forth an Elemental spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the {@creature Elemental Spirit|XPHB} stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an element: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. The creature resembles a bipedal form wreathed in the chosen element, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your {@variantrule Initiative|XPHB} count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the {@action Dodge|XPHB} action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**At Higher Levels.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.
