| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Teleport | 7 | Conjuration | 10 ft. | Instant | 3d10 Force | - |

This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be Large or smaller, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.

The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls {@dice 1d100} and consults the {@variantrule Teleportation|XPHB} Outcome table and the explanations after it.

### Familiarity

Here are the meanings of the terms in the table's Familiarity column:

### Mishap

The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes {@damage 3d10} Force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).

### Similar Area

You and your group (or the target object) appear in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. You appear in the closest similar place. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might appear in another person's laboratory in the same city.

### Off Target

You and your group (or the target object) appear {@dice 2d12} miles away from the destination in a random direction. Roll {@dice 1d8} for the direction: 1, east; 2, southeast; 3, south; 4, southwest; 5, west; 6, northwest; 7, north; or 8, northeast.

### On Target

You and your group (or the target object) appear where you intended.
