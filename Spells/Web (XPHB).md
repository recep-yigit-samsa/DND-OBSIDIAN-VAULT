|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Web | 2 | Conjuration | 60 ft. | Timed | 2d4 Fire | - |

You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point within range. The webs fill a 20-foot Cube there for the duration. The webs are {@variantrule Difficult Terrain|XPHB}, and the area within them is {@variantrule Lightly Obscured|XPHB}.

If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

The first time a creature enters the webs on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the {@condition Restrained|XPHB} condition while in the webs or until it breaks free.

A creature {@condition Restrained|XPHB} by the webs can take an action to make a Strength ({@skill Athletics|XPHB}) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer {@condition Restrained|XPHB}.

The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot Cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing {@damage 2d4} Fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.
