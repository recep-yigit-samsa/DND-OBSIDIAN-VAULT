Lightning springs from you to a creature that you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 1d8} Lightning damage, and it can't make Opportunity Attacks until the start of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@damage 1d8} when you reach levels 5 ({@damage 2d8}), 11 ({@damage 3d8}), and 17 ({@damage 4d8}).
