You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. The creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, or {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot, the slot isn't expended.
