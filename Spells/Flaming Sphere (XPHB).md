# Flaming Sphere

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Flaming Sphere | 2 | Conjuration | 60 ft. | Timed | 2d6 Fire | - |

You create a 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 2d6} Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet, rolling it along the ground. If you move the sphere into a creature's space, that creature makes the save against the sphere, and the sphere stops moving for the turn.

When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. Flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried start {@hazard burning|XPHB} if touched by the sphere, and it sheds {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} in a 20-foot radius and {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} for an additional 20 feet.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d6|2-9|1d6} for each spell slot level above 2.
