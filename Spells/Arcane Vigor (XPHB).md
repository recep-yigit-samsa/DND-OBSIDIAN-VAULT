You tap into your life force to heal yourself. Roll one or two of your unexpended {@variantrule Hit Point Dice|XPHB}, and regain a number of {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} equal to the roll's total plus your spellcasting ability modifier. Those dice are then expended.

**At Higher Levels.** The number of unexpended Hit Dice you can roll increases by one for each spell slot level above 2.
