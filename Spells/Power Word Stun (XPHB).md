You overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range. If the target has 150 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} or fewer, it has the {@condition Stunned|XPHB} condition. Otherwise, its {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} is 0 until the start of your next turn.

The {@condition Stunned|XPHB} target makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself on a success.
