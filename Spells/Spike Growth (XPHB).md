# Spike Growth

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Spike Growth | 2 | Transmutation | 150 ft. | Timed | 2d4 Piercing | - |

The ground in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes {@variantrule Difficult Terrain|XPHB} for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes {@damage 2d4} Piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area when the spell is cast must take a {@action Search|XPHB} action and succeed on a Wisdom ({@skill Perception|XPHB} or {@skill Survival|XPHB}) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
