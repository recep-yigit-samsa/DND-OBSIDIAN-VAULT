# Call Lightning

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Call Lightning | 3 | Conjuration | 120 ft. | Timed | 3d10 Lightning | - |

A storm cloud appears at a point within range that you can see above yourself. It takes the shape of a Cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius.

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A lightning bolt shoots from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 3d10} Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Until the spell ends, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to call down lightning in that way again, targeting the same point or a different one.

If you're outdoors in a storm when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over that storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by {@damage 1d10}.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d10|3-9|1d10} for each spell slot level above 3.
