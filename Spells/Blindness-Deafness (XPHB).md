One creature that you can see within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the {@condition Blinded|XPHB} or {@condition Deafened|XPHB} condition (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

**At Higher Levels.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 2.
