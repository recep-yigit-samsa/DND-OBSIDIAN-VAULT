| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |

| Polymorph | 4 | Transmutation | 60 ft. | Timed | - | - |

You attempt to transform a creature that you can see within range into a Beast. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or shape-shift into Beast form for the duration. That form can be any {@filter Beast|bestiary|type=beast|miscellaneous=!swarm} you choose that has a {@variantrule Challenge Rating|XPHB} equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level if it doesn't have a {@variantrule Challenge Rating|XPHB}). The target's game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen Beast, but the target retains its alignment, personality, creature type, {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, and {@variantrule Hit Point Dice|XPHB}.

The target gains a number of {@variantrule Temporary Hit Points|XPHB} equal to the {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} of the Beast form. The spell ends early on the target if it has no {@variantrule Temporary Hit Points|XPHB} left.

The target is limited in the actions it can perform by the anatomy of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells.

The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't use or otherwise benefit from any of that equipment.
