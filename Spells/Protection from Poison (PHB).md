# Protection from Poison

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Protection from Poison | 2 | Abjuration | Point | Timed | - | - |

You touch a creature. If it is {@condition poisoned}, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.

For the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being {@condition poisoned}, and it has resistance to poison damage.
