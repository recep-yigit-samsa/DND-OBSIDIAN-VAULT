# Blight

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Blight | 4 | Necromancy | 30 ft. | Instant | 8d8 Necrotic | - |

A creature that you can see within range makes a Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 8d8} Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Plant creature automatically fails the save.

Alternatively, target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub. It doesn't make a save; it simply withers and dies.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 8d8|4-9|1d8} for each spell slot level above 4.
