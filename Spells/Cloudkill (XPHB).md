# Cloudkill

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Cloudkill | 5 | Conjuration | 120 ft. | Timed | 5d8 Poison | - |

You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of yellow-green fog centered on a point within range. The fog lasts for the duration or until strong wind (such as the one created by {@spell Gust of Wind|XPHB}) disperses it, ending the spell. Its area is {@variantrule Heavily Obscured|XPHB}.

Each creature in the Sphere makes a Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 5d8} Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the Sphere moves into its space and when it enters the Sphere or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

The Sphere moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 5d8|5-9|1d8} for each spell slot level above 5.
