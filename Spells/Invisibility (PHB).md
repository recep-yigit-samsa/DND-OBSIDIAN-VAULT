A creature you touch becomes {@condition invisible} until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is {@condition invisible} as long as it is on the target's person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
