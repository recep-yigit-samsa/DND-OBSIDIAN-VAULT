You create an {@condition Invisible|XPHB}, invulnerable eye within range that hovers for the duration. You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which can see in every direction. It also has {@sense Darkvision|XPHB} with a range of 30 feet.

As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.
