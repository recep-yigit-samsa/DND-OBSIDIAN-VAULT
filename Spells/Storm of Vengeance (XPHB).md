A churning storm cloud forms for the duration, centered on a point within range and spreading to a radius of 300 feet. Each creature under the cloud when it appears must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take {@damage 2d6} Thunder damage and have the {@condition Deafened|XPHB} condition for the duration.

At the start of each of your later turns, the storm produces different effects, as detailed below.

### Turn 2

Acidic rain falls. Each creature and object under the cloud takes {@damage 4d6} Acid damage.

### Turn 3

You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six different creatures or objects beneath it. Each target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 10d6} Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Turn 4

Hailstones rain down. Each creature under the cloud takes {@damage 2d6} Bludgeoning damage.

### Turns 5-10

Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. Each creature there takes {@damage 1d6} Cold damage. Until the spell ends, the area is {@variantrule Difficult Terrain|XPHB} and {@variantrule Heavily Obscured|XPHB}, ranged attacks with weapons are impossible there, and strong wind blows through the area.
