As you hit the creature, this spell creates a rain of thorns that sprouts from your Ranged weapon or ammunition. The target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it make a Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 1d10} Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 1d10|1-9|1d10} for each spell slot level above 1.
