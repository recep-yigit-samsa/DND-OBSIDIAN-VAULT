When you cast this spell, you gain one {@adventure level of contamination|DoDk|12}. Octarine rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different colour and has a different power and purpose, see the table below. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. For each target, roll a {@dice d8} to determine which colour ray affects it.
