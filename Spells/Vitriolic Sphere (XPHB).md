# Vitriolic Sphere

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Vitriolic Sphere | 4 | Evocation | 150 ft. | Instant | 10d4 Acid + 5d4 Acid | - |

You point at a location within range, and a glowing, 1-foot-diameter ball of acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 10d4} Acid damage and another {@damage 5d4} Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage only.

**At Higher Levels.** The initial damage increases by {@scaledamage 10d4|4-9|2d4} for each spell slot level above 4.
