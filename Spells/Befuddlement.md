You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes {@damage 10d12} Psychic damage and can't cast spells or take the {@action Magic|XPHB} action. At the end of every 30 days, the target repeats the save, ending the effect on a success. The effect can also be ended by the {@spell Greater Restoration|XPHB}, {@spell Heal|XPHB}, or {@spell Wish|XPHB} spell. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.
