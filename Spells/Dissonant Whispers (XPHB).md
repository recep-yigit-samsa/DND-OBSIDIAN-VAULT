One creature of your choice that you can see within range hears a discordant melody in its mind. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes {@damage 3d6} Psychic damage and must immediately use its {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB}, if available, to move as far away from you as it can, using the safest route. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d6|1-9|1d6} for each spell slot level above 1.
