# Wall of Thorns

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Wall of Thorns | 6 | Conjuration | 120 ft. | Timed | 7d8 Piercing + 7d8 Slashing | - |

You create a wall of tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.

When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 7d8} Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters a space in the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 7d8} Slashing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**At Higher Levels.** Both types of damage increase by {@scaledamage 7d8|6-9|1d8} for each spell slot level above 6.
