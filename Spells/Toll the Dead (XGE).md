# Toll the Dead

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Toll the Dead | 0 | Necromancy | 60 ft. | Instant | 1d8 necrotic + 1d12 necrotic | - |

You point at one creature you can see within range, and the sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it for a moment. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take {@damage 1d8} necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its hit points, it instead takes {@damage 1d12} necrotic damage.

The spell's damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level ({@damage 2d8} or {@damage 2d12}), 11th level ({@damage 3d8} or {@damage 3d12}), and 17th level ({@damage 4d8} or {@damage 4d12}).
