# Flame Blade

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Flame Blade | 2 | Evocation | Point | Timed | 3d6 | - |

You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke it again as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}.

As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you can make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes Fire damage equal to {@damage 3d6} plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

The flaming blade sheds {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} in a 10-foot radius and {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} for an additional 10 feet.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d6|2-9|1d6} for each spell slot level above 2.
