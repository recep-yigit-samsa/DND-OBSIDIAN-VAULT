Your touch inflicts a magical contagion. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take {@damage 11d8} Necrotic damage and have the {@condition Poisoned|XPHB} condition. Also, choose one ability when you cast the spell. While {@condition Poisoned|XPHB}, the target has {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on saving throws made with the chosen ability.

The target must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns until it gets three successes or failures. If the target succeeds on three of these saves, the spell ends on the target. If the target fails three of the saves, the spell lasts for 7 days on it.

Whenever the {@condition Poisoned|XPHB} target receives an effect that would end the {@condition Poisoned|XPHB} condition, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the {@condition Poisoned|XPHB} condition doesn't end on it.
