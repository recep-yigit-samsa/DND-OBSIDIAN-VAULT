One creature of your choice that you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has the {@condition Prone|XPHB} and {@condition Incapacitated|XPHB} conditions for the duration. During that time, it laughs uncontrollably if it's capable of laughter, and it can't end the {@condition Prone|XPHB} condition on itself.

At the end of each of its turns and each time it takes damage, it makes another Wisdom saving throw. The target has {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on the save if the save is triggered by damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level about 1.
