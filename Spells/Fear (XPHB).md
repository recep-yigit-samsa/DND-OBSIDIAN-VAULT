# Fear

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Fear | 3 | Illusion | 30 ft. | Timed | - | - |

Each creature in a 30-foot Cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and have the {@condition Frightened|XPHB} condition for the duration.

A {@condition Frightened|XPHB} creature takes the {@action Dash|XPHB} action and moves away from you by the safest route on each of its turns unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a space where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends on that creature.
