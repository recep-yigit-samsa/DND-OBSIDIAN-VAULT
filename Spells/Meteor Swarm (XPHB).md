# Meteor Swarm

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Meteor Swarm | 9 | Evocation | 1 ft. | Instant | 20d6 Fire + 20d6 Bludgeoning | - |

Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius Sphere centered on each of those points makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 20d6} Fire damage and {@damage 20d6} Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery Sphere is affected only once.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area, and the object starts {@hazard burning|XPHB} if it's flammable.
