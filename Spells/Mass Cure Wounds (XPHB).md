A wave of healing energy washes out from a point you can see within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point. Each target regains {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} equal to {@dice 5d8} plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

**At Higher Levels.** The healing increases by {@scaledice 5d8|5-9|1d8} for each spell slot level above 5.
