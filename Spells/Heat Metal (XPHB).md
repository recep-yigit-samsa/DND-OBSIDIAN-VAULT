Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of Heavy or Medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes {@damage 2d8} Fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} on each of your later turns to deal this damage again if the object is within range.

If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object, it has {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d8|2-9|1d8} for each spell slot level above 2.
