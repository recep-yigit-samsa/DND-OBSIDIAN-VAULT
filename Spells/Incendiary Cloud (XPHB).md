# Incendiary Cloud

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |

| Incendiary Cloud | 8 | Conjuration | 150 ft. | Timed | 10d8 Fire | - |

A swirling cloud of embers and smoke fills a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud's area is {@variantrule Heavily Obscured|XPHB}. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (like that created by {@spell Gust of Wind|XPHB}) disperses it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 10d8} Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the Sphere moves into its space and when it enters the Sphere or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

The cloud moves 10 feet away from you in a direction you choose at the start of each of your turns.
