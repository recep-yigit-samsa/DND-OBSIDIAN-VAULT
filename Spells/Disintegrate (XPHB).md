# Disintegrate

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Disintegrate | 6 | Transmutation | 60 ft. | Instant | 10d6 + 40 Force | - |

You launch a green ray at a target you can see within range. The target can be a creature, a nonmagical object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by {@spell Wall of Force|XPHB}.

A creature targeted by this spell makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes {@damage 10d6 + 40} Force damage. If this damage reduces it to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, it and everything nonmagical it is wearing and carrying are disintegrated into gray dust. The target can be revived only by a {@spell True Resurrection|XPHB} or a {@spell Wish|XPHB} spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If such a target is Huge or larger, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-Cube portion of it.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 10d6 + 40|6-9|3d6} for each spell slot level above 6.
