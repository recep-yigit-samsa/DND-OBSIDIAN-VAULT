| Thunderwave | 1 | Evocation | 15 ft. | Instant | 2d8 Thunder | - |

You unleash a wave of thunderous energy. Each creature in a 15-foot Cube originating from you makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 2d8} Thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

In addition, unsecured objects that are entirely within the Cube are pushed 10 feet away from you, and a thunderous boom is audible within 300 feet.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d8|1-9|1d8} for each spell slot level above 1.
