| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |

| Ensnaring Strike | 1 | Conjuration | Point | Timed | 1d6 Piercing | - |

As you hit the target, grasping vines appear on it, and it makes a Strength saving throw. A Large or larger creature has {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on this save. On a failed save, the target has the {@condition Restrained|XPHB} condition until the spell ends. On a successful save, the vines shrivel away, and the spell ends.

While {@condition Restrained|XPHB}, the target takes {@damage 1d6} Piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. The target or a creature within reach of it can take an action to make a Strength ({@skill Athletics|XPHB}) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 1d6|1-9|1d6} for each spell slot level above 1.
