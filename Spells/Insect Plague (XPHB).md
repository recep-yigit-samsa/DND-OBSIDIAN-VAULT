# Insect Plague

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Insect Plague | 5 | Conjuration | 300 ft. | Timed | 4d10 Piercing | - |

Swarming locusts fill a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The Sphere remains for the duration, and its area is {@variantrule Lightly Obscured|XPHB} and {@variantrule Difficult Terrain|XPHB}.

When the swarm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 4d10} Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 4d10|5-9|1d10} for each spell slot level above 5.
