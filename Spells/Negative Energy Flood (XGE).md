# Negative Energy Flood

| Negative Energy Flood | 5 | Necromancy | 60 ft. | Instant | 5d12 necrotic | - |

You send ribbons of negative energy at one creature you can see within range. Unless the target is undead, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 5d12} necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target killed by this damage rises up as a {@creature zombie} at the start of your next turn. The zombie pursues whatever creature it can see that is closest to it. Statistics for the {@creature zombie} are in the Monster Manual.

If you target an undead with this spell, the target doesn't make a saving throw. Instead, roll {@dice 5d12}. The target gains half the total as temporary hit points.
