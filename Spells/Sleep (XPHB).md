# Sleep

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Sleep | 1 | Enchantment | 60 ft. | Timed | - | - |

Each creature of your choice in a 5-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the {@condition Incapacitated|XPHB} condition until the end of its next turn, at which point it must repeat the save. If the target fails the second save, the target has the {@condition Unconscious|XPHB} condition for the duration. The spell ends on a target if it takes damage or someone within 5 feet of it takes an action to shake it out of the spell's effect.

Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, or that have {@variantrule Immunity|XPHB} to the {@condition Exhaustion|XPHB} condition automatically succeed on saves against this spell.
