# Conjure Celestial

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Conjure Celestial | 7 | Conjuration | 90 ft. | Timed | - | - |

You conjure a spirit from the Upper Planes, which manifests as a pillar of light in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. For each creature you can see in the Cylinder, choose which of these lights shines on it:

Until the spell ends, {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} fills the Cylinder, and when you move on your turn, you can also move the Cylinder up to 30 feet.

Whenever the Cylinder moves into the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Cylinder or ends its turn there, you can bathe it in one of the lights. A creature can be affected by this spell only once per turn.

**At Higher Levels.** The healing and damage increase by {@scaledamage 6d12|7-9|1d12} for each spell slot level above 7.
