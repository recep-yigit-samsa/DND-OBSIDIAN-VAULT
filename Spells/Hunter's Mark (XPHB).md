| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Hunter's Mark | 1 | Divination | 90 ft. | Timed | 1d6 Force | - |

You magically mark one creature you can see within range as your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra {@damage 1d6} Force damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack roll. You also have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on any Wisdom ({@skill Perception|XPHB} or {@skill Survival|XPHB}) check you make to find it.

If the target drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} before this spell ends, you can take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to move the mark to a new creature you can see within range.

**At Higher Levels.** Your {@status Concentration|XPHB} can last longer with a spell slot of level 3-4 (up to 8 hours) or 5+ (up to 24 hours).
