# Wall of Fire

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Wall of Fire | 4 | Evocation | 120 ft. | Timed | 5d8 Fire + 5d8 Fire | - |

You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 5d8} Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals {@damage 5d8} Fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 5d8|4-9|1d8} for each spell slot level above 4.
