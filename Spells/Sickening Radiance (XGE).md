| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |

| Sickening Radiance | 4 | Evocation | 120 ft. | Timed | 4d10 radiant | - |

Dim, greenish light spreads within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The light spreads around corners, and it lasts until the spell ends.

When a creature moves into the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take {@damage 4d10} radiant damage, and it suffers one level of {@condition exhaustion} and emits a dim, greenish light in a 5-foot radius. This light makes it impossible for the creature to benefit from being {@condition invisible}. The light and any levels of {@condition exhaustion} caused by this spell go away when the spell ends.
