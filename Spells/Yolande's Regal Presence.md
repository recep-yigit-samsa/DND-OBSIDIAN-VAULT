You surround yourself with unearthly majesty in a 10-foot Emanation. Whenever the Emanation enters the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes {@damage 4d6} Psychic damage and has the {@condition Prone|XPHB} condition, and you can push it up to 10 feet away. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. A creature makes this save only once per turn.
