| Harm | 6 | Necromancy | 60 ft. | Instant | 14d6 Necrotic | - |

You unleash virulent magic on a creature you can see within range. The target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes {@damage 14d6} Necrotic damage, and its {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB|Hit Point} maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage it took. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only. This spell can't reduce a target's {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB|Hit Point} maximum below 1.
