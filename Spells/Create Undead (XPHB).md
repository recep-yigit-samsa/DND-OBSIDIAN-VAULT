You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small Humanoids within range. Each one becomes a {@creature Ghoul|XMM} under your control (see the {@book Monster Manual|XMM} for its stat block).

As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to them). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move on its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular place. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the {@action Dodge|XPHB} action and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow the order until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell rather than animating new ones.

**At Higher Levels.** If you use a level 7 spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four {@creature Ghoul|XMM|Ghouls}. If you use a level 8 spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five {@creature Ghoul|XMM|Ghouls} or two {@creature Ghast|XMM|Ghasts} or {@creature Wight|XMM|Wights}. If you use a level 9 spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over six {@creature Ghoul|XMM|Ghouls}, three {@creature Ghast|XMM|Ghasts} or {@creature Wight|XMM|Wights}, or two {@creature Mummy|XMM|Mummies}. See the {@book Monster Manual|XMM} for these stat blocks.
