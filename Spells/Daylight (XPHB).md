# Daylight

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Daylight | 3 | Evocation | 60 ft. | Timed | - | - |

For the duration, sunlight spreads from a point within range and fills a 60-foot-radius Sphere. The sunlight's area is {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} and sheds {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} for an additional 60 feet.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the sunlight to fill a 60-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the sunlight.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of {@variantrule Darkness|XPHB} created by a spell of level 3 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.
