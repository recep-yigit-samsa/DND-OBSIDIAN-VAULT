# Grasping Vine

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |

| Grasping Vine | 4 | Conjuration | 60 ft. | Timed | 4d8 Bludgeoning | - |

You conjure a vine that sprouts from a surface in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The vine lasts for the duration.

Make a melee spell attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 4d8} Bludgeoning damage and is pulled up to 30 feet toward the vine; if the target is Huge or smaller, it has the {@condition Grappled|XPHB} condition (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). The vine can grapple only one creature at a time, and you can cause the vine to release a {@condition Grappled|XPHB} creature (no action required).

As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} on your later turns, you can repeat the attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine.

**At Higher Levels.** The number of creatures the vine can grapple increases by one for each spell slot level above 4.
