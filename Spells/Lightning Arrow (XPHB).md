# Lightning Arrow

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Lightning Arrow | 3 | Transmutation | Point | Instant | 4d8 Lightning + 2d8 Lightning | - |

As your attack hits or misses the target, the weapon or ammunition you're using transforms into a lightning bolt. Instead of taking any damage or other effects from the attack, the target takes {@damage 4d8} Lightning damage on a hit or half as much damage on a miss. Each creature within 10 feet of the target then makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 2d8} Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The weapon or ammunition then returns to its normal form.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage for both effects of the spell increases by {@scaledamage 4d8;2d8|3-9|1d8} for each spell slot level above 3.
