For the duration, your eyes become an inky void. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects of your choice for the duration.

On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to target another creature but can't target a creature again if it has succeeded on a save against this casting of the spell.

### Asleep

The target has the {@condition Unconscious|XPHB} condition. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

### Panicked

The target has the {@condition Frightened|XPHB} condition. On each of its turns, the {@condition Frightened|XPHB} target must take the {@action Dash|XPHB} action and move away from you by the safest and shortest route available. If the target moves to a space at least 60 feet away from you where it can't see you, this effect ends.

### Sickened

The target has the {@condition Poisoned|XPHB} condition.
