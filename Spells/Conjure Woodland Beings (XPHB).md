| Conjure Woodland Beings | 4 | Conjuration | 10 ft. | Timed | 5d8 Force | - |

You conjure nature spirits that flit around you in a 10-foot Emanation for the duration. Whenever the Emanation enters the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes {@damage 5d8} Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

In addition, you can take the {@action Disengage|XPHB} action as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} for the spell's duration.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 5d8|4-9|1d8} for each spell slot level above 4.
