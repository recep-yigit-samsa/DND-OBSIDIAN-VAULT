Protective magical frost surrounds you. You gain 5 {@variantrule Temporary Hit Points|XPHB}. If a creature hits you with a melee attack roll before the spell ends, the creature takes 5 Cold damage. The spell ends early if you have no {@variantrule Temporary Hit Points|XPHB}.

**At Higher Levels.** The {@variantrule Temporary Hit Points|XPHB} and the Cold damage both increase by 5 for each spell slot level above 1.
