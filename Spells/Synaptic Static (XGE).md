You choose a point within range and cause psychic energy to explode there. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can't be affected by this spell. A target takes {@damage 8d6} psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a {@dice d6} and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain {@status concentration}. The target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
