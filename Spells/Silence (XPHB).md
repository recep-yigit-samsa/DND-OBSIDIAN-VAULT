For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the Sphere has {@variantrule Immunity|XPHB} to Thunder damage, and creatures have the {@condition Deafened|XPHB} condition while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a Verbal component is impossible there.
