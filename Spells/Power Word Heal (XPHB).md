A wave of healing energy washes over one creature you can see within range. The target regains all its {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}. If the creature has the {@condition Charmed|XPHB}, {@condition Frightened|XPHB}, {@condition Paralyzed|XPHB}, {@condition Poisoned|XPHB}, or {@condition Stunned|XPHB} condition, the condition ends. If the creature has the {@condition Prone|XPHB} condition, it can use its {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to stand up.
