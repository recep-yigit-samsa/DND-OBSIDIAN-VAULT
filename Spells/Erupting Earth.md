| Erupting Earth | 3 | Transmutation | 120 ft. | Instant | 3d12 bludgeoning | - |

Choose a point you can see on the ground within range. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 3d12} bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes {@quickref difficult terrain||3} until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d12|3-9|1d12} for each slot level above 3rd.
