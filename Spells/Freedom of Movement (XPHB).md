| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Freedom of Movement | 4 | Abjuration | Point | Timed | - | - |

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by {@variantrule Difficult Terrain|XPHB}, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} nor cause the target to have the {@condition Paralyzed|XPHB} or {@condition Restrained|XPHB} conditions. The target also has a {@variantrule Swim Speed|XPHB} equal to its {@variantrule Speed|XPHB}.

In addition, the target can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature imposing the {@condition Grappled|XPHB} condition on it.

**At Higher Levels.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.
