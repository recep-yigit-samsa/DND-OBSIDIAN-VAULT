| Hypnotic Pattern | 3 | Illusion | 120 ft. | Timed | - | - |

You create a twisting pattern of colors in a 30-foot Cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who can see the pattern must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the {@condition Charmed|XPHB} condition for the duration. While {@condition Charmed|XPHB}, the creature has the {@condition Incapacitated|XPHB} condition and a {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} of 0.

The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
