A beam of enervating energy shoots from you toward a creature within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the target has {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on the next attack roll it makes until the start of your next turn.

On a failed save, the target has {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on Strength-based {@variantrule D20 Test|XPHB|D20 Tests} for the duration. During that time, it also subtracts {@dice 1d8} from all its damage rolls. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success.
