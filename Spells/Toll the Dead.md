# Toll the Dead

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Toll the Dead | 0 | Necromancy | 60 ft. | Instant | 1d8 Necrotic + 1d12 Necrotic | - |

You point at one creature you can see within range, and the single chime of a dolorous bell is audible within 10 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take {@damage 1d8} Necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, it instead takes {@damage 1d12} Necrotic damage.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by one die when you reach levels 5 ({@damage 2d8} or {@damage 2d12}), 11 ({@damage 3d8} or {@damage 3d12}), and 17 ({@damage 4d8} or {@damage 4d12}).
