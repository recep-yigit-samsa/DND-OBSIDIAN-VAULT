| Banishing Smite | 5 | Conjuration | Point | Timed | 5d10 Force | - |

The target hit by the attack roll takes an extra {@damage 5d10} Force damage from the attack. If the attack reduces the target to 50 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} or fewer, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be transported to a harmless demiplane for the duration. While there, the target has the {@condition Incapacitated|XPHB} condition. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
