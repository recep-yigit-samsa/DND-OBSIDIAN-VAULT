# Ensnaring Strike

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Ensnaring Strike | 1 | Conjuration | Point | Timed | 1d6 piercing | - |

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, a writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the point of impact, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be {@condition restrained} by the magical vines until the spell ends. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw. If the target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away.

While {@condition restrained} by this spell, the target takes {@damage 1d6} piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature {@condition restrained} by the vines or one that can touch the creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is freed.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 1d6|1-9|1d6} for each slot level above 1st.
