|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Hunger of Hadar | 3 | Conjuration | 150 ft. | Timed | 2d6 Cold + 2d6 Acid | - |

You open a gateway to the Far Realm, a region infested with unspeakable horrors. A 20-foot-radius Sphere of {@variantrule Darkness|XPHB} appears, centered on a point with range and lasting for the duration. The Sphere is {@variantrule Difficult Terrain|XPHB}, and it is filled with strange whispers and slurping noises, which can be heard up to 30 feet away. No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within it have the {@condition Blinded|XPHB} condition.

Any creature that starts its turn in the area takes {@damage 2d6} Cold damage. Any creature that ends its turn there must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take {@damage 2d6} Acid damage from otherworldly tentacles.

**At Higher Levels.** The Cold or Acid damage (your choice) increases by {@scaledamage 2d6|3-9|1d6} for each spell slot level above 3.
