| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Sunburst | 8 | Evocation | 150 ft. | Instant | 12d6 Radiant | - |

Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in the Sphere makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 12d6} Radiant damage and has the {@condition Blinded|XPHB} condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only.

A creature {@condition Blinded|XPHB} by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

This spell dispels {@variantrule Darkness|XPHB} in its area that was created by any spell.
