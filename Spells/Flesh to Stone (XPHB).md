| Flesh to Stone | 6 | Transmutation | 60 ft. | Timed | - | - |

You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into stone. The target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it has the {@condition Restrained|XPHB} condition for the duration. On a successful save, its {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} is 0 until the start of your next turn. Constructs automatically succeed on the save.

A {@condition Restrained|XPHB} target makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and has the {@condition Petrified|XPHB} condition for the duration. The successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

If you maintain your {@status Concentration|XPHB} on this spell for the entire possible duration, the target is {@condition Petrified|XPHB} until the condition is ended by {@spell Greater Restoration|XPHB} or similar magic.
