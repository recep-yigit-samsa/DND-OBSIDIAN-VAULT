# Giant Insect

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Giant Insect | 4 | Transmutation | 30 ft. | Timed | - | - |

You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a {@creature giant centipede}, a spider becomes a {@creature giant spider}, a wasp becomes a {@creature giant wasp}, and a scorpion becomes a {@creature giant scorpion}.

Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The DM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.

A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.

The DM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a {@creature giant wasp}.
