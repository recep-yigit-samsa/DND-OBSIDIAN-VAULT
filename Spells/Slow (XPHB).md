| Slow | 3 | Transmutation | 120 ft. | Timed | - | - |

You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot Cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.

An affected target's {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't take Reactions. On its turns, it can take either an action or a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, not both, and it can make only one attack if it takes the {@action Attack|XPHB} action. If it casts a spell with a Somatic component, there is a {@chance 25|||The spell fails!|The spell does not fail.} chance the spell fails as a result of the target making the spell's gestures too slowly.

An affected target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a success.
