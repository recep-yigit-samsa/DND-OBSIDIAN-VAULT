A flickering flame appears in your hand and remains there for the duration. While there, the flame emits no heat and ignites nothing, and it sheds {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} in a 20-foot radius and {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} for an additional 20 feet. The spell ends if you cast it again.

Until the spell ends, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to hurl fire at a creature or an object within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 1d8} Fire damage.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@damage 1d8} when you reach levels 5 ({@damage 2d8}), 11 ({@damage 3d8}), and 17 ({@damage 4d8}).
