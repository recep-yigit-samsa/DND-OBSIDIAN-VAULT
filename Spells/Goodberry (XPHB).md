Ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB|Hit Point}, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.

Uneaten berries disappear when the spell ends.
