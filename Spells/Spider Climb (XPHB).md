Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also gains a {@variantrule Climb Speed|XPHB} equal to its {@variantrule Speed|XPHB}.

**At Higher Levels.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level about 2.
