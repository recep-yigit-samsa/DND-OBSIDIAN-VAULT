# Enlarge/Reduce

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Enlarge/Reduce | 2 | Transmutation | 30 ft. | Timed | 1d4 less | - |

For the duration, the spell enlarges or reduces a creature or an object you can see within range (see the chosen effect below). A targeted object must be neither worn nor carried. If the target is an unwilling creature, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the spell has no effect.

Everything that a targeted creature is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item it drops returns to normal size at once. A thrown weapon or piece of ammunition returns to normal size immediately after it hits or misses a target.

### Enlarge

The target's size increases by one category—from Medium to Large, for example. The target also has {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's attacks with its enlarged weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal an extra {@damage 1d4} damage on a hit.

### Reduce

The target's size decreases by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. The target also has {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's attacks with its reduced weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal {@damage 1d4} less damage on a hit (this can't reduce the damage below 1).
