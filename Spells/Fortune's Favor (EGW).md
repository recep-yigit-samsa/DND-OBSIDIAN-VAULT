You impart latent luck to yourself or one willing creature you can see within range. When the chosen creature makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw before the spell ends, it can dismiss this spell on itself to roll an additional {@dice d20} and choose which of the {@dice d20}s to use. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the chosen creature, it can dismiss this spell on itself to roll a {@dice d20} and choose which of the {@dice d20}s to use, the one it rolled or the one the attacker rolled.

If the original {@dice d20} roll has advantage or disadvantage, the creature rolls the additional {@dice d20} after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to the original roll.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
