One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the target dances comically until the end of its next turn, during which it must spend all its movement to dance in place.

On a failed save, the target has the {@condition Charmed|XPHB} condition for the duration. While {@condition Charmed|XPHB}, the target dances comically, must use all its movement to dance in place, and has {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls, and other creatures have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on attack rolls against it. On each of its turns, the target can take an action to collect itself and repeat the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.
