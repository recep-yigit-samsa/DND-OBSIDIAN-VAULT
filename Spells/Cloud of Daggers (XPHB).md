You conjure spinning daggers in a 5-foot Cube centered on a point within range. Each creature in that area takes {@damage 4d4} Slashing damage. A creature also takes this damage if it enters the Cube or ends its turn there or if the Cube moves into its space. A creature takes this damage only once per turn.

On your later turns, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to teleport the Cube up to 30 feet.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 4d4|2-9|2d4} for each spell slot level above 2.
