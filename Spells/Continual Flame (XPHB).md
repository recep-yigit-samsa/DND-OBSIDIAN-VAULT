A flame springs from an object that you touch. The effect casts {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} in a 20-foot radius and {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} for an additional 20 feet. It looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and consumes no fuel. The flame can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.
