# Sunbeam

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Sunbeam | 6 | Evocation | Point | Timed | 6d8 Radiant | - |

You launch a sunbeam in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long Line. Each creature in the Line makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 6d8} Radiant damage and has the {@condition Blinded|XPHB} condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only.

Until the spell ends, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to create a new Line of radiance.

For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines above you. It sheds {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} in a 30-foot radius and {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.
