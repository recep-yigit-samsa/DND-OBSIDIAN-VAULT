# Moonbeam

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Moonbeam | 2 | Evocation | 120 ft. | Timed | 2d10 Radiant | - |

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} fills the Cylinder, and you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action on later turns to move the Cylinder up to 60 feet.

When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 2d10} Radiant damage, and if the creature is shape-shifted (as a result of the {@spell Polymorph|XPHB} spell, for example), it reverts to its true form and can't shape-shift until it leaves the Cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also makes this save when the spell's area moves into its space and when it enters the spell's area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d10|2-9|1d10} for each spell slot level above 2.
