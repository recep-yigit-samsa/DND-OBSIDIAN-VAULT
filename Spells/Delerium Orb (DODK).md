When you cast this spell, you gain one {@adventure level of contamination|DoDk|12}. You draw chaotic magical power from the delerium fragment held in your hand, and blast a creature you can see within range with paradoxical power. Choose one ability score, then choose cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, psychic, or radiant damage. The target must succeed on a saving throw using the chosen ability score; it takes {@damage 6d6} damage of the chosen type on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by {@damage 2d6} for each slot level above 1st.
