You touch another creature that is willing and create a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.

The spell ends if you drop to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures.
