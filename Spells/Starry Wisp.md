You launch a mote of light at one creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 1d8} Radiant damage, and until the end of your next turn, it emits {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} in a 10-foot radius and can't benefit from the {@condition Invisible|XPHB} condition.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@damage 1d8} when you reach levels 5 ({@damage 2d8}), 11 ({@damage 3d8}), and 17 ({@damage 4d8}).
