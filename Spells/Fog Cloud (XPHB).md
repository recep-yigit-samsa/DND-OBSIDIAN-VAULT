You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The Sphere is {@variantrule Heavily Obscured|XPHB}. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (such as one created by {@spell Gust of Wind|XPHB}) disperses it.

**At Higher Levels.** The fog's radius increases by 20 feet for each spell slot level above 1.
