For the duration, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with Beasts, and you can use any of the {@action Influence|XPHB} action's skill options with them.

Most Beasts have little to say about topics that don't pertain to survival or companionship, but at minimum, a Beast can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever it has perceived within the past day.
