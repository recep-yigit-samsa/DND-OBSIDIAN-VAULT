# Vampiric Touch

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Vampiric Touch | 3 | Necromancy | Point | Timed | 3d6 Necrotic | - |

The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within reach. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 3d6} Necrotic damage, and you regain {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} equal to half the amount of Necrotic damage dealt.

Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, targeting the same creature or a different one.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d6|3-9|1d6} for each spell slot level above 3.
