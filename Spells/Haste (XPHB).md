# Haste

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Haste | 3 | Transmutation | 30 ft. | Timed | - | - |

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to {@variantrule Armor Class|XPHB}, it has {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used to take only the {@action Attack|XPHB} (one attack only), {@action Dash|XPHB}, {@action Disengage|XPHB}, {@action Hide|XPHB}, or {@action Utilize|XPHB} action.

When the spell ends, the target is {@condition Incapacitated|XPHB} and has a {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} of 0 until the end of its next turn, as a wave of lethargy washes over it.
