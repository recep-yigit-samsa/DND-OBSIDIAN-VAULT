Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be {@condition restrained} by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature {@condition restrained} by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself. When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.
