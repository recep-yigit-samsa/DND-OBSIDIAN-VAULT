You apply alchemical fluids or holy water to a contaminated humanoid creature while reciting an exacting magical chant that expels eldritch contaminants from the target's body. When you finish casting the spell, all {@adventure contamination levels|DoDk|12} and mutations are removed from the creature. It then gains one level of {@condition exhaustion} for each {@adventure contamination level|DoDk|12} removed with this spell.
