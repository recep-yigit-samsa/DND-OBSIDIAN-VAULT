# Fireball

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Fireball | 3 | Evocation | 150 ft. | Instant | 8d6 Fire | - |

A bright streak flashes from you to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into a fiery explosion. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 8d6} Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried start {@hazard burning|XPHB}.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 8d6|3-9|1d6} for each spell slot level above 3.
