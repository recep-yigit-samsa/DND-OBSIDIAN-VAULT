When you cast this spell, you gain one {@adventure level of contamination|DoDk|12}. A stroke of eldritch lightning forming a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 10d6} lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You then teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within the line's area.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by {@damage 2d6} for each slot level above 3rd.
