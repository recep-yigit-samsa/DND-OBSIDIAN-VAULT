| Freedom of Movement | 4 | Abjuration | Point | Timed | - | - |

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by {@quickref difficult terrain||3}, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be {@condition paralyzed} or {@condition restrained}.

The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it {@condition grappled}. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target's movement or attacks.
