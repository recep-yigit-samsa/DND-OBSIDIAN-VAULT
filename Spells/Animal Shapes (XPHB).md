Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. Each target shape-shifts into a Large or smaller Beast of your choice that has a {@variantrule Challenge Rating|XPHB} of 4 or lower. You can choose a different form for each target. On later turns, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to transform the targets again.

A target's game statistics are replaced by the chosen Beast's statistics, but the target retains its creature type; {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}; {@variantrule Hit Point Dice|XPHB}; alignment; ability to communicate; and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target's actions are limited by the Beast form's anatomy, and it can't cast spells. The target's equipment melds into the new form, and the target can't use any of that equipment while in that form.

The target gains a number of {@variantrule Temporary Hit Points|XPHB} equal to the Beast form's {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}. The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, until the target has no {@variantrule Temporary Hit Points|XPHB}, or until the target leaves the form as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}.
