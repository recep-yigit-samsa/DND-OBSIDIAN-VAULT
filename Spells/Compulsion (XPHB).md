Each creature of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the {@condition Charmed|XPHB} condition until the spell ends.

For the duration, you can take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to designate a direction that is horizontal to you. Each {@condition Charmed|XPHB} target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its next turn, taking the safest route. After moving in this way, a target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.
