You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take {@damage 5d6} thunder damage, as well as {@damage 5d6} radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked {@condition prone}. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked {@condition prone}.
