This spell may only be cast in an area covered by the Deep Haze.

You perform a holy ceremony involving up to 12 faithful and willing humanoid creatures that ends when each participating creature drives a delerium shard into their chest. Those creatures become sanctified (see the Followers of the Falling Fire dossier in chapter 3 of Dungeons of Drakkenheim).

When you finish casting this spell, a hostile {@creature shadow} appears and attacks each participant, as a manifestation of that character's inner darkness. The GM may determine that a character who carries great anger, fear, or hate in their heart causes a {@creature wraith} to manifest instead.
