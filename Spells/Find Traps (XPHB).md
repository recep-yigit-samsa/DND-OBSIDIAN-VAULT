# Find Traps

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |

You sense any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes any object or mechanism that was created to cause damage or other danger. Thus, the spell would sense the {@spell Alarm|XPHB} or {@spell Glyph of Warding|XPHB} spell or a mechanical pit trap, but it wouldn't reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

This spell reveals that a trap is present but not its location. You do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.
