# Wall of Ice

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Wall of Ice | 6 | Evocation | 120 ft. | Timed | 10d6 Cold + 5d6 Cold | - |

You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a globe with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.

If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose which side) and makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 10d6} Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} per 10-foot section, and it has {@variantrule Immunity|XPHB} to Cold, Poison, and Psychic damage and {@variantrule Vulnerability|XPHB} to Fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied.

A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn makes a Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 5d6} Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage the wall deals when it appears increases by {@scaledamage 10d6|6-9|2d6} and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by {@scaledamage 5d6|6-9|1d6} for each spell slot level above 6.
