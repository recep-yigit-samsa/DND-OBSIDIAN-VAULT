# Evard's Black Tentacles

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Evard's Black Tentacles | 4 | Conjuration | 90 ft. | Timed | 3d6 Bludgeoning | - |

Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in that area into {@variantrule Difficult Terrain|XPHB}.

Each creature in that area makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes {@damage 3d6} Bludgeoning damage, and it has the {@condition Restrained|XPHB} condition until the spell ends. A creature also makes that save if it enters the area or ends it turn there. A creature makes that save only once per turn.

A {@condition Restrained|XPHB} creature can take an action to make a Strength ({@skill Athletics|XPHB}) check against your spell save DC, ending the condition on itself on a success.
