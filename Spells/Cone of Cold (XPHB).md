You unleash a blast of cold air. Each creature in a 60-foot Cone originating from you makes a Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 8d8} Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 8d8|5-9|1d8} for each spell slot level above 5.
