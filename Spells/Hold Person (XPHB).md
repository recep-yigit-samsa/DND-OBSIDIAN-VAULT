Choose a Humanoid that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the {@condition Paralyzed|XPHB} condition for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

**At Higher Levels.** You can target one additional Humanoid for each spell slot level above 2.
