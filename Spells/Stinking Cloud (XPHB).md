You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud is {@variantrule Heavily Obscured|XPHB}. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a strong wind (such as the one created by {@spell Gust of Wind|XPHB}) disperses it.

Each creature that starts its turn in the Sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the {@condition Poisoned|XPHB} condition until the end of the current turn. While {@condition Poisoned|XPHB} in this way, the creature can't take an action or a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}.
