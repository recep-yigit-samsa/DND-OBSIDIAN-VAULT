| Blade Barrier | 6 | Evocation | 90 ft. | Timed | 6d10 slashing | - |

You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides {@quickref Cover||3||three-quarters cover} to creatures behind it, and its space is {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.

When a creature enters the wall's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes {@damage 6d10} slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
