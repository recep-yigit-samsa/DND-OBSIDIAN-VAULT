A loud noise erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered there makes a Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 3d8} Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Construct has {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on the save.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d8|2-9|1d8} for each spell slot level above 2.
