# Maze

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Maze | 8 | Conjuration | 60 ft. | Timed | - | 20 |

You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.

The target can take a {@action Study|XPHB} action to try to escape. When it does so, it makes a {@dc 20} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation|XPHB}) check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends.

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.
