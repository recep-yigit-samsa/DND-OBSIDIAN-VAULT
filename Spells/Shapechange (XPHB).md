# Shapechange

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Shapechange | 9 | Transmutation | Point | Timed | - | - |

You shape-shift into another creature for the duration or until you take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to shape-shift into a different eligible form. The new form must be of a creature that has a {@variantrule Challenge Rating|XPHB} no higher than your level or {@variantrule Challenge Rating|XPHB}. You must have seen the sort of creature before, and it can't be a Construct or an Undead.

When you shape-shift, you gain a number of {@variantrule Temporary Hit Points|XPHB} equal to the {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} of the form. The spell ends early if you have no {@variantrule Temporary Hit Points|XPHB} left.

Your game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen form, but you retain your creature type; alignment; personality; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}; {@variantrule Hit Point Dice|XPHB}; proficiencies; and ability to communicate. If you have the Spellcasting feature, you retain it too.

Upon shape-shifting, you determine whether your equipment drops to the ground or changes in size and shape to fit the new form while you're in it.
