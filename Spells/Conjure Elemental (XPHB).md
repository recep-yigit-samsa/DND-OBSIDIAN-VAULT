# Conjure Elemental

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Conjure Elemental | 5 | Conjuration | 60 ft. | Timed | 8d8 + 4d8 | - |

You conjure a Large, intangible spirit from the Elemental Planes that appears in an unoccupied space within range. Choose the spirit's element, which determines its damage type: air (Lightning), earth (Thunder), fire (Fire), or water (Cold). The spirit lasts for the duration.

Whenever a creature you can see enters the spirit's space or starts its turn within 5 feet of the spirit, you can force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw if the spirit has no creature {@condition Restrained|XPHB}. On failed save, the target takes {@damage 8d8} damage of the spirit's type, and the target has the {@condition Restrained|XPHB} condition until the spell ends. At the start of each of its turns, the {@condition Restrained|XPHB} target repeats the save. On a failed save, the target takes {@damage 4d8} damage of the spirit's type. On a successful save, the target isn't {@condition Restrained|XPHB} by the spirit.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 8d8;4d8|5-9|2d8} for each spell slot level above 5.
