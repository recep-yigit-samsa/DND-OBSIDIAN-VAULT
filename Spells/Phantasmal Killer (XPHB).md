On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the spell ends.

For the duration, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes the Psychic damage again. On a successful save, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 4d10|4-9|1d10} for each spell slot level above 4.
