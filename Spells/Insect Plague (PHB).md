# Insect Plague

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Insect Plague | 5 | Conjuration | 300 ft. | Timed | 4d10 piercing | - |

Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is {@quickref Vision and Light|PHB|2||lightly obscured}. The sphere's area is {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.

When the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 4d10} piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 4d10|5-9|1d10} for each slot level above 5th.
