Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch has {@variantrule Immunity|XPHB} to Psychic damage and the {@condition Charmed|XPHB} condition. The target is also unaffected by anything that would sense its emotions or alignment, read its thoughts, or magically detect its location, and no spell—not even {@spell Wish|XPHB}—can gather information about the target, observe it remotely, or control its mind.
