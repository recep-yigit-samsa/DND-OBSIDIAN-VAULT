You negate contaminated magical energies in a 10-foot radius sphere. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centred on you. Creatures in the sphere (including you) can't gain {@adventure contamination levels|DoDk|12} and have immunity to necrotic damage. Contaminated spells can't be cast by creatures in the area.
