The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your weapon flares with bright light, and the attack deals an extra {@damage 3d8} radiant damage to the target. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be {@condition blinded} until the spell ends. A creature {@condition blinded} by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer {@condition blinded}.
