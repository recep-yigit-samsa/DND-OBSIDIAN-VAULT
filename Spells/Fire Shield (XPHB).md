# Fire Shield

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Fire Shield | 4 | Evocation | Point | Timed | 2d8 Fire + 2d8 Cold | - |

Wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} in a 10-foot radius and {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} for an additional 10 feet.

The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} to Cold damage, and the chill shield grants you {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} to Fire damage.

In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack roll, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes {@damage 2d8} Fire damage from a warm shield or {@damage 2d8} Cold damage from a chill shield.
