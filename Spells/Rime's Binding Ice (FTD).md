| Rime's Binding Ice | 2 | Evocation | 30 ft. | Instant | 3d8 cold | - |

A burst of cold energy emanates from you in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 3d8} cold damage and is hindered by ice formations for 1 minute, or until it or another creature within reach of it uses an action to break away the ice. A creature hindered by ice has its speed reduced to 0. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't hindered by ice.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the cold damage by {@scaledamage 3d8|2-9|1d8} for each slot level above 2nd.
