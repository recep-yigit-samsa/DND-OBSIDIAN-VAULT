Objects in a 20-foot Cube within range are outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Each creature in the Cube is also outlined if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} in a 10-foot radius and can't benefit from the {@condition Invisible|XPHB} condition.

{@action Attack|XPHB} rolls against an affected creature or object have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} if the attacker can see it.
