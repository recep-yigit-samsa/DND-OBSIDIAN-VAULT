| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Arms of Hadar | 1 | Conjuration | 10 ft. | Instant | 2d6 Necrotic | - |

Invoking Hadar, you cause tendrils to erupt from yourself. Each creature in a 10-foot Emanation originating from you makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes {@damage 2d6} Necrotic damage and can't take Reactions until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d6|1-9|1d6} for each spell slot level above 1.
