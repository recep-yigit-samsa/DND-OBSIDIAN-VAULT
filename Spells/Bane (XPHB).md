Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must each make a Charisma saving throw. Whenever a target that fails this save makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target must subtract {@dice 1d4} from the attack roll or save.

**At Higher Levels.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.
