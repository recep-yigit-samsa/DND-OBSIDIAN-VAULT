|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Weird | 9 | Illusion | 120 ft. | Timed | 10d10 Psychic + 5d10 Psychic | - |

You try to create illusory terrors in others' minds. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes {@damage 10d10} Psychic damage and has the {@condition Frightened|XPHB} condition for the duration. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.

A {@condition Frightened|XPHB} target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes {@damage 5d10} Psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends on that target.
