| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Hex | 1 | Enchantment | 90 ft. | Timed | 1d6 Necrotic | - |

You place a curse on a creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra {@damage 1d6} Necrotic damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack roll. Also, choose one ability when you cast the spell. The target has {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on ability checks made with the chosen ability.

If the target drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} before this spell ends, you can take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} on a later turn to curse a new creature.

**At Higher Levels.** Your {@status Concentration|XPHB} can last longer with a spell slot of level 2 (up to 4 hours), 3-4 (up to 8 hours), or 5+ (24 hours).
