Destructive energy ripples outward from you in a 30-foot Emanation. Each creature you choose in the Emanation makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes {@damage 5d6} Thunder damage and {@damage 5d6} Radiant or Necrotic damage (your choice) and has the {@condition Prone|XPHB} condition. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.
