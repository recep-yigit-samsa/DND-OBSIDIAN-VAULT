The force appears within range in a space of your choice, and you can immediately make one melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of the force. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal to {@damage 1d8} plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} on your later turns, you can move the force up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 1d8|2-9|1d8} for every slot level above 2.
