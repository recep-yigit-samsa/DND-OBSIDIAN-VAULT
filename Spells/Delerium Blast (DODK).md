When you cast this spell, you gain one {@adventure level of contamination|DoDk|12}.

You ignite arcane energies stored inside a delerium fragment held in your hand, and hurl it towards a space you can see within range. It explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere of erratic psychic energy that overwhelms the minds and senses of those within. Each creature in the sphere must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes ({@damage 10d6}) psychic damage and becomes {@condition incapacitated} until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and suffers none of the spell's other effects.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by {@damage 2d6} for each slot level above 4th.
