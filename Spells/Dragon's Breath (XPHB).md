You touch one willing creature, and choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison. Until the spell ends, the target can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to exhale a 15-foot Cone. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 3d6} damage of the chosen type on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d6|2-9|1d6} for each spell slot level above 2.
