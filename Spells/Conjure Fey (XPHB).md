# Conjure Fey

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Conjure Fey | 6 | Conjuration | 60 ft. | Timed | 3d12 | - |

You conjure a Medium spirit from the Feywild in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The spirit lasts for the duration, and it looks like a Fey creature of your choice. When the spirit appears, you can make one melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes Psychic damage equal to {@damage 3d12} plus your spellcasting ability modifier, and the target has the {@condition Frightened|XPHB} condition until the start of your next turn, with both you and the spirit as the source of the fear.

As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} on your later turns, you can teleport the spirit to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of the space it left and make the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

**At Higher Levels.** The damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d12|6-9|2d12} for each spell slot level above 6.
