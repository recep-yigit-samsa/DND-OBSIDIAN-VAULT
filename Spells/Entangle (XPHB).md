Grasping plants sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into {@variantrule Difficult Terrain|XPHB}. They disappear when the spell ends.

Each creature (other than you) in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have the {@condition Restrained|XPHB} condition until the spell ends. A {@condition Restrained|XPHB} creature can take an action to make a Strength ({@skill Athletics|XPHB}) check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself from the grasping plants and is no longer {@condition Restrained|XPHB} by them.
