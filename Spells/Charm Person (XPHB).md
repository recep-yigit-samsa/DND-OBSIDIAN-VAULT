One Humanoid you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. It does so with {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} if you or your allies are fighting it. On a failed save, the target has the {@condition Charmed|XPHB} condition until the spell ends or until you or your allies damage it. The {@condition Charmed|XPHB} creature is Friendly to you. When the spell ends, the target knows it was {@condition Charmed|XPHB} by you.

**At Higher Levels.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.
