| Spray of Cards | 2 | Conjuration | 15 ft. | Instant | 2d10 force | - |

You spray a 15-foot cone of spectral cards. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 2d10} force damage and has the {@condition blinded} condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d10|2-9|1d10} for each slot level above 2nd.
