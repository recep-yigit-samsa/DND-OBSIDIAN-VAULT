# Light

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Light | 0 | Evocation | Point | Timed | - | - |

You touch one Large or smaller object that isn't being worn or carried by someone else. Until the spell ends, the object sheds {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} in a 20-foot radius and {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like.

Covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again.
