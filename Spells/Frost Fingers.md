Freezing cold blasts from your fingertips in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 2d8} cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The cold freezes nonmagical liquids in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by {@damage 1d8} for each slot level above 1st.
