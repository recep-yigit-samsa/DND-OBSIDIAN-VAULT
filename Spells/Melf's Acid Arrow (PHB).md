| Melf's Acid Arrow | 2 | Evocation | 90 ft. | Instant | 4d4 acid + 2d4 acid | - |

A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 4d4} acid damage immediately and {@damage 2d4} acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by {@scaledamage 4d4;2d4|2-9|1d4} for each slot level above 2nd.
