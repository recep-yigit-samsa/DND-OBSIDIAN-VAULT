# Jallarzi's Storm of Radiance

| Name | Level | School | Range | Duration | Damage | Save DC & Type |
|------|-------|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Jallarzi's Storm of Radiance | 5 | Evocation | 120 ft. | Timed | 2d10 Radiant + 2d10 Thunder | - |

You unleash a storm of flashing light and raging thunder in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point you can see within range. While in this area, creatures have the {@condition Blinded|XPHB} and {@condition Deafened|XPHB} conditions, and they can't cast spells with a Verbal component.

When the storm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 2d10} Radiant damage and {@damage 2d10} Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**At Higher Levels.** The Radiant and Thunder damage increase by {@scaledamage 2d10|5-9|1d10} for each spell slot level above 5.
