**Multiattack.** The githzerai makes three Unarmed Strike or Psychic Bolt attacks. It can replace any of these attacks with one use of its Pacifying Touch.

**Unarmed Strike.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d8 + 3}) bludgeoning damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) psychic damage.

**Psychic Bolt.** {@atk rs} {@hit 6} to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. {@h}17 ({@damage 5d6}) psychic damage.

**Pacifying Touch.** The githzerai touches one creature it can see within 5 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Intelligence saving throw, or the githzerai chooses an action for that target: Attack, Cast a Spell, or Dash. The affected target can't take that action for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. A target that succeeds on the saving throw becomes immune to this githzerai's Pacifying Touch for 24 hours.
