**Multiattack.** Juiblex makes three acid lash attacks.

**Acid Lash.** {@atk mw} {@hit 14} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}21 ({@damage 4d6 + 7}) acid damage. Any creature killed by this attack is drawn into Juiblex's body, and the corpse is obliterated after 1 minute.

**Eject Slime {@recharge 5}.** Juiblex spews out a corrosive slime, targeting one creature that it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a {@dc 21} Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 55 ({@damage 10d10}) acid damage. Unless the target avoids taking any of this damage, any metal armor worn by the target takes a permanent −1 penalty to the AC it offers, and any metal weapon it is carrying or wearing takes a permanent −1 penalty to damage rolls. The penalty worsens each time a target is subjected to this effect. If the penalty on an object drops to −5, the object is destroyed.
