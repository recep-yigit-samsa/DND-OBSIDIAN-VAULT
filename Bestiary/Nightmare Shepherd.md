**Multiattack.** The shepherd makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its staff.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) slashing damage plus 16 ({@damage 3d10}) necrotic damage.

**Staff.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) bludgeoning damage, or 13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands, plus 26 ({@damage 4d12}) psychic damage.

**Herd the Underworld (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The shepherd pulls twisted souls from the Underworld; {@dice 1d6} {@creature shadow||shadows} (without Sunlight Weakness) arise in unoccupied spaces within 20 feet of the shepherd. The shadows act right after the shepherd on the same initiative count and fight until they're destroyed. They disappear when the shepherd dies.
