**Scimitar.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d6 + 2}) slashing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) psychic damage.

**Psychic Bolt.** {@atk rs} {@hit 6} to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. {@h}14 ({@damage 3d6 + 4}) psychic damage.

**Hooked Spider Net.** {@atk rw} {@hit 4} to hit, range 10/30 ft., one target. {@h}4 ({@damage 1d4 + 2}) piercing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) psychic damage, and the target is {@condition restrained}. While {@condition restrained}, the target takes 5 ({@damage 1d10}) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. Any creature, including the {@condition restrained} target, can take an action to remove the net by succeeding on a {@dc 14} Strength check. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the creature breaks the net instead, and the folk of Leng can't use the broken net again until it finishes a long rest.
