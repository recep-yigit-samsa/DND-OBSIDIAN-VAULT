**Multiattack.** The hellion makes two Morningstar attacks.

**Morningstar.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 3d8 + 7}) piercing damage plus 11 ({@damage 2d10}) fire damage. If the target is a creature, it can't regain hit points until the start of the hellion's next turn.

**Infernal Orb.** The hellion hurls a magical ball of fire that explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the hellion can see within 120 feet of itself. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 17} Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 18 ({@damage 4d8}) fire damage and 18 ({@damage 4d8}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
