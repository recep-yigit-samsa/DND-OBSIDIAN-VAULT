**Multiattack.** The corpse walker makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) bludgeoning damage and 5 ({@damage 2d4}) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the corpse walker regains hit points equal to that amount. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. An evil humanoid slain this way rises 24 hours later as a corpse walker.
