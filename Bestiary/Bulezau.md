**Barbed Tail.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d12 + 2}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw against disease or become {@condition poisoned} until the disease ends. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, the target sports festering boils, coughs up flies, and sheds rotting skin, and the target must repeat the saving throw after every 24 hours that elapse. On a successful save, the disease ends. On a failed save, the target's hit point maximum is reduced by 4 ({@dice 1d8}). The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.
