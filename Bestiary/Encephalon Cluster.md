**Multiattack.** The cluster makes two Slam attacks. It can replace one of these attacks with Spawn Progeny if available.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d10 + 6}) bludgeoning damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) psychic damage, and if the target is a creature, the target must succeed on a {@dc 18} Strength saving throw or have the {@condition prone} condition. If this attack reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target immediately dies and is consumed by the cluster.

**Spawn Progeny (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The cluster bulges and spews {@dice 1d4} mature eggs. Each egg lands in an unoccupied space of the cluster's choice within 30 feet of itself and immediately transforms into an {@creature encephalon gemmule|PaBTSO}. The gemmules obey the cluster's commands and take their turns immediately after it.
