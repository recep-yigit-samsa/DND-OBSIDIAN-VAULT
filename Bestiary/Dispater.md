**Multiattack.** Dispater makes four attacks using his Wrought- Iron Tower, Iron Column, or a combination of the two. He can replace one of the attacks with Superheat Metal (if available).

**Wrought-Iron Tower.** {@atk mw} {@hit 20} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}21 ({@damage 2d8 + 12}) bludgeoning damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) fire damage. Dispater may replace the bludgeoning damage with damage of a type that the target is vulnerable to instead.

**Iron Column.** {@atk rs} {@hit 15} to hit, range 60 ft., one target. {@h}21 ({@damage 2d8 + 12}) bludgeoning damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) fire damage. Dispater may replace the bludgeoning damage with damage of a type that the target is vulnerable to instead.

**Superheat Metal {@recharge 4}.** Dispater targets a metal object he can see within 90 feet of him. The metal glows white-hot, burning all that touches it. If the object was held by a creature, the creature must succeed on a {@dc 23} Dexterity saving throw to drop the object or take 45 ({@damage 10d8}) fire damage. If the object is attached to a creature, or they couldn't feasibly drop it, they automatically fail the save. The object returns to room temperature at the end of Dispater's turn.

**Nail Spray (2/Day).** Dispater conjures a storm of iron nails and launches them forward in a 90-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line. All creatures within the line must make a {@dc 23} Dexterity saving throw, taking 40 ({@damage 16d4}) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Nails launched from this ability stick into soft surfaces or fall to the ground after the attack finishes.
