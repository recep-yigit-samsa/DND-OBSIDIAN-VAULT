**Multiattack.** The hag makes three Claw attacks. If two Claw attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of {@condition exhaustion}. A creature can't suffer more than two levels of {@condition exhaustion} from this effect.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) slashing damage.

**Illusory Appearance.** The sand hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and Humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a {@dc 20} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

**Scouring Sirocco {@recharge 5}.** The sand hag generates a blast of hot wind and sand in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 14 ({@damage 4d6}) slashing damage and 9 ({@damage 2d8}) fire damage and is {@condition blinded} for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't {@condition blinded}. A {@condition blinded} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The area is heavily obscured by airborne sand until the start of the sand hag's next turn.
