**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}4 ({@damage 1d4 + 2}) bludgeoning damage.

**Use Magic Item {@recharge 5}.** The kalke activates a magic item in its possession and can ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the item. The kalke must make a {@dc 11} Intelligence saving throw. On a success, the item activates normally. On a failure, the item doesn't activate and can't be used again until the next dawn. If the kalke fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it causes a magical backlash. Each creature within 5 feet of the kalke, including the kalke, must make a {@dc 11} Dexterity saving throw, taking 5 ({@damage 2d4}) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
