**Shocking Grasp (Cantrip).** {@atk ms} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature (the attack roll has advantage if the target is wearing armor made of metal). {@h}9 ({@damage 2d8}) lightning damage, and the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

**Acid Splash (Cantrip).** The simulacrum hurls a bubble of acid at one creature it can see within 60 feet of it, or at two such creatures that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a {@dc 13} Dexterity saving throw or take 7 ({@damage 2d6}) acid damage.

**Magic Missile (1st-Level Spell; Requires a Spell Slot).** The simulacrum creates three darts of magical force. Each dart unerringly strikes one creature the simulacrum can see within 120 feet of it, dealing 3 ({@damage 1d4 + 1}) force damage. If the simulacrum casts this spell using a 2nd-level spell slot, it creates one more dart.
