**Multiattack.** Neronvain makes two attacks, either with his shortsword or Eldritch Arrow.

**Shortsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) piercing damage plus 13 ({@damage 3d8}) poison damage.

**Eldritch Arrow.** {@atk rs} {@hit 7} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d10}) force damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) poison damage.

**Poisonous Cloud (2/Day).** Poison gas fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point Neronvain can see within 50 feet of him. The gas spreads around corners and remains until the start of Neronvain's next turn. Each creature that starts its turn in the gas must succeed on a {@dc 16} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
