**Multiattack.** The bagiennik makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) slashing damage.

**Acid Spray.** The bagiennik sprays acid on one creature it can see within 30 feet of it, creating a puddle of oil beneath the creature. The target must make a {@dc 13} Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 18 ({@damage 4d8}) acid damage and is knocked {@condition prone}. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked {@condition prone}. The slippery oil covers the ground in a 5-foot square centered on the point where the target was standing for 1 minute. A creature that enters the oily area or ends its turn there must succeed on a {@dc 13} Dexterity saving throw or fall {@condition prone}.

**Healing Oil (3/Day).** The bagiennik applies healing oil to a creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target magically regains 7 {@dice 2d6} hp and is freed from any disease or poison. The target must then succeed on a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw or its speed is halved and it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws for 1 minute.
