**Multiattack.** The mirager makes two Slam attacks. If both Slam attacks hit a Medium or smaller creature, the target is also {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 13}). The mirager can grapple only one creature at a time.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) bludgeoning damage.

**Thirsting Kiss.** {@atk ms} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is {@condition grappled} by the mirager, {@condition incapacitated}, or {@condition restrained}. {@h}22 ({@damage 4d8 + 4}) necrotic damage, and the mirager gains temporary hp equal to half that amount.

**Blow Kiss.** The mirager blows a kiss at a creature {@condition charmed} by it. The target must make a {@dc 14} Charisma saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 17 ({@damage 5d6}) psychic damage and is {@condition stunned} until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and the {@condition charmed} condition immediately ends on it.

**Illusory Appearance.** The mirager covers itself and anything it is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes it look like another creature of its general size and Humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the mirager takes a bonus action to end it or if the mirager dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the mirager could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching it would feel its rough, sand-like skin. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a {@dc 20} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to discern that the mirager is disguised.
