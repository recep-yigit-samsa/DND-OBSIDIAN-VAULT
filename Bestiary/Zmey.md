**Multiattack.** The zmey makes two Claw attacks and as many Bite attacks as it has heads.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}19 ({@damage 2d12 + 6}) piercing damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 4d6 + 6}) slashing damage.

**Fire Breath {@recharge 5}.** The zmey exhales fire in a 30-foot cone out of each of its heads. Each creature in a cone must make a {@dc 17} Dexterity saving throw, taking 49 ({@damage 14d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the cones overlap, each creature in the overlapping cones must make one saving throw with disadvantage against only one of the cones rather than one saving throw for each cone. The zmey can choose for this breath to not harm plants or Plant creatures.
