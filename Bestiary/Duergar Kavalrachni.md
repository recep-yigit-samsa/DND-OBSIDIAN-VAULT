**Multiattack.** The duergar makes two war pick attacks.

**War Pick.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d8 + 2}) piercing damage plus 5 ({@damage 2d4}) poison damage.

**Heavy Crossbow.** {@atk rw} {@hit 2} to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d10}) piercing damage.

**Shared Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The duergar magically turns {@condition invisible} for up to 1 hour or until it attacks, it casts a spell, or its {@status concentration} is broken (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). Any equipment the duergar wears or carries is {@condition invisible} with it. While the {@condition invisible} duergar is mounted on a female steeder, the steeder is {@condition invisible} as well. The invisibility ends early on the steeder immediately after it attacks.
