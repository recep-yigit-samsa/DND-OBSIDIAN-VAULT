**Multiattack.** The phylaskia makes two longsword attacks and uses its Strength Drain once.

**Longsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d8 + 5}) slashing damage, or 16 ({@damage 2d10 + 5}) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 11 ({@damage 2d10}) necrotic damage.

**Strength Drain.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) necrotic damage. Unless the target is immune to necrotic damage, its Strength score is reduced by {@dice 1d4}. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.
