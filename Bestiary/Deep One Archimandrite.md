**Multiattack.** The deep one archimandrite makes one Claw attack and one Unholy Trident attack, or it makes three Jolt attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 3d8 + 5}) slashing damage.

**Unholy Trident.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d8 + 5}) piercing damage plus 13 ({@damage 2d12}) necrotic damage.

**Jolt.** {@atk ms,rs} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 3d6 + 4}) lightning damage, and the target's speed is reduced by 10 until the end of its next turn.

**Call of the Archimandrite (1/Day).** With a ringing shout, the archimandrite magically calls {@dice 1d4} reef sharks or 1 swarm of quippers, provided the archimandrite is at least partially submerged in a body of water that can contain the creatures. The called creatures arrive in {@dice 1d4} rounds, acting as allies of the archimandrite and obeying its spoken commands. The creatures remain for 1 hour, until the archimandrite dies, or until the archimandrite dismisses them as a bonus action. Each deep one within 1 mile of the archimandrite can hear this call, though these deep ones are under no magical compulsion to make their way toward the archimandrite.
