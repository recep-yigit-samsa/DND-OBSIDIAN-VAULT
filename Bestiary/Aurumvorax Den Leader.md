**Multiattack.** The aurumvorax makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature wearing armor of any type, the aurumvorax gains one of the following benefits of its choice:

**Frenzy.** The aurumvorax has advantage on attack rolls until start of its next turn.

**Invigorate.** The aurumvorax regains 6 ({@dice 1d8 + 2}) hit points.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) slashing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 14}). Until this grapple ends, the aurumvorax can't use its Claw attack on another target, and when it moves, it can drag the {@condition grappled} creature with it, without the aurumvorax's speed being halved.
