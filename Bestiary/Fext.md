**Multiattack.** The fext makes two Eldritch Blade or Eldritch Fury attacks.

**Eldritch Fury.** {@atk rs} {@hit 7} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 3d8 + 4}) force damage.

**Patron's Might {@recharge 5}.** The fext channels its patron's aweâ€‘inspiring presence, terrifying those nearby. Each creature within 10 feet of the fext must make a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 ({@damage 10d6}) psychic damage and is {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't {@condition frightened}. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
