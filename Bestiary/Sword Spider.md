**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d8 + 3}) piercing damage, and the target must make a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw, taking 9 ({@damage 2d8}) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and has the {@condition paralyzed} condition while {@condition poisoned} in this way.
