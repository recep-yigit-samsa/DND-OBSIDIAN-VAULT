**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}1 piercing damage, and the dipsa attaches to the target. While attached, the dipsa can't attack, and at the start of each of the dipsa's turns, the target takes 3 ({@damage 1d6}) acid damage and must succeed on a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw or have its hp maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. The attached dipsa moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the dipsa's movement. It can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the dipsa.
