**Multiattack.** The elemental locus makes three Slam attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spawn Elemental.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 15} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}31 ({@damage 5d8 + 9}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 18} Strength saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}.

**Spawn Elemental.** The elemental locus magically creates up to {@dice 2d6} mephits or 1 Elemental with a challenge rating of 5 or lower. The Elementals arrive at the start of the locus's next turn, acting as allies of the locus and obeying its spoken commands. The locus can create only Elementals that share an element with a terrain feature comprising at least 100,000 square feet of the locus's bound land. For example, a desert-bound locus can't create a water-based Elemental, unless its bound desert contains an oasis or other source of water around the size of a small pond. The Elementals remain for 1 hour, until the locus dies, or until the locus dismisses them as a bonus action. The locus can have any number of Elementals under its control at one time, provided the combined total CR of the Elementals is no higher than 8.
