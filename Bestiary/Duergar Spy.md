**Multiattack.** The spy makes two shortsword attacks.

**Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, the spy magically increases in size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. While enlarged, the spy is Large, doubles her damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks (included in the attacks), and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage. If the spy lacks the room to become Large, it attains the maximum size possible in the space available.

**Shortsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) piercing damage, or 10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) piercing damage while enlarged.

**Hand Crossbow.** {@atk rw} {@hit 5} to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) piercing damage.

**Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The spy magically turns {@condition invisible} until it attacks, deals damage, casts a spell, or uses its Enlarge, or until its {@status concentration} is broken, up to 1 hour (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). Any equipment the spy wears or carries is {@condition invisible} with it.
