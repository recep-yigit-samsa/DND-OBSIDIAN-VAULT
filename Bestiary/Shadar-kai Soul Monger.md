**Multiattack.** The shadar-kai makes two Shadow Dagger attacks.

**Shadow Dagger.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 4d4 + 3}) piercing damage plus 19 ({@damage 3d12}) necrotic damage, and the target has disadvantage on saving throws until the end of the shadar-kai's next turn. {@hom}The dagger magically returns to the shadar-kai's hand immediately after a ranged attack.

**Wave of Weariness {@recharge 4}.** The shadar-kai emits weariness in a 60-foot cube. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 16} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 45 ({@damage 10d8}) psychic damage and suffers 1 level of {@condition exhaustion}. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and doesn't gain a level of {@condition exhaustion}.
