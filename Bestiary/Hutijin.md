**Multiattack.** Hutijin makes four attacks: one with his bite, one with his claw, one with his mace, and one with his tail.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 15} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d6 + 8}) piercing damage. The target must succeed on a {@dc 22} Constitution saving throw or become {@condition poisoned}. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, the target can't regain hit points, and it takes 10 ({@damage 3d6}) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The {@condition poisoned} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 15} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d8 + 8}) slashing damage.

**Mace.** {@atk mw} {@hit 15} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d6 + 8}) bludgeoning damage.

**Tail.** {@atk mw} {@hit 15} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}19 ({@damage 2d10 + 8}) bludgeoning damage.

**Teleport.** Hutijin magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.
