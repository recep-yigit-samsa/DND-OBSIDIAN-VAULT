**Multiattack.** Brusipha makes two Eldritch Blast attacks.

**Eldritch Blast.** {@atk rs} {@hit 5} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d10 + 3}) force damage.

**Gore.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) piercing damage plus 4 ({@damage 1d8}) necrotic damage. If Brusipha moved at least 10 feet straight toward the target immediately before she hit, the target takes an extra 4 ({@damage 1d8}) piercing damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 15} Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet from Brusipha and have the {@condition prone} condition.

**Incite the Hunters (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** Brusipha allows each ally within 30 feet of herself that has the Unerring Tracker trait to make one weapon attack as a reaction against the target of that ally's Unerring Tracker.
