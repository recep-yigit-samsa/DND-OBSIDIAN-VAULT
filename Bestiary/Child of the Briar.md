**Multiattack.** The child of the briar makes two Claw attacks. If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller creature, the target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 13}). At the start of each of the {@condition grappled} creature's turns, it takes 2 ({@damage 1d4}) piercing damage. The child of the briar can have only one target {@condition grappled} at a time.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) piercing damage.

**Spitdart Tongue {@recharge 4}.** {@atk rw} {@hit 5} to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) piercing damage.

**Entangle.** While within 10 feet of at least one other child of the briar, this child can cast the {@spell entangle} spell (spell save {@dc 13}). Each friendly child of the briar within 30 feet of this child can use its reaction to join the casting. For each child beyond the first participating in the casting, the save DC increases by 1, to a maximum of {@dc 17}, and the size increases by 5 feet, to a maximum of a 40-foot square. The entangled area must include at least one of the children involved in the casting. All participating children of the briar are immune to the spell's effects.
