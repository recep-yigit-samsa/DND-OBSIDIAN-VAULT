**Blood Drain.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}The treacle attaches to the target. While attached, the treacle can't attack, and at the start of each of the treacle's turns, the target loses 5 {@dice 2d4} hp due to blood loss. Each time the target loses hp in this way, it must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to notice the treacle is attached and harming it, otherwise it is unaware the hp loss is from the treacle. A creature that loses hp in this way while below half its hp maximum automatically succeeds on this check. The attached treacle moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the treacle's movement. It can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the treacle.
