**Multiattack.** The professor makes two Spectral Scroll attacks. It can also use Weight of {@skill History}, if available.

**Spectral Scroll.** {@atk ms} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d10 + 4}) force damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 15} Strength saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}.

**Weight of History {@recharge 5}.** The professor magically compresses time around up to six creatures of its choice that it can see within 30 feet of itself. Each target must succeed on a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition restrained} for 1 minute, but the {@condition restrained} target's speed is halved instead of being reduced to 0. At the start of each of its turns, the {@condition restrained} target takes 4 ({@damage 1d8}) force damage. A {@condition restrained} target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
