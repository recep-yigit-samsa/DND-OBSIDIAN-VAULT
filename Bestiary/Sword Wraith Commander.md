**Multiattack.** The sword wraith makes two weapon attacks.

**Longsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) slashing damage, or 9 ({@damage 1d10 + 4}) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Longbow.** {@atk rw} {@hit 5} to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d8 + 2}) piercing damage.

**Call to Honor (1/Day).** To use this action, the sword wraith must have taken damage during the current combat. If the sword wraith can use this action, it gives itself advantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn, and {@dice 1d4 + 1} {@creature sword wraith warrior|mtf|sword wraith warriors} appear in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of it. The warriors last until they drop to 0 hit points, and they take their turns immediately after the commander's turn on the same initiative count.
