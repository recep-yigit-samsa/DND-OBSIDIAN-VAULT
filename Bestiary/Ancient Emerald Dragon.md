**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 14} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 2d10 + 7}) piercing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) psychic damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 14} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d6 + 7}) slashing damage.

**Disorienting Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a wave of psychic dissonance in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 22} Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 56 ({@damage 16d6}) psychic damage, and until the end of its next turn, when the creature makes an attack roll or an ability check, it must roll a {@dice d8} and reduce the total by the number rolled. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage with no additional effects.
