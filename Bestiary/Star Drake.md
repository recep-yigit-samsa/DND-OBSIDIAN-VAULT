**Multiattack.** The drake makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, or it makes four Searing Star attacks. If two Searing Star attacks hit one creature, that creature must succeed on a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition blinded} until the end of its next turn.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d10 + 5}) piercing damage plus 18 ({@damage 4d8}) force damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) slashing damage plus 18 ({@damage 4d8}) force damage.

**Searing Star.** {@atk rs} {@hit 12} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d6 + 7}) radiant damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) force damage.

**Planar Traveler.** The star drake can transport itself to a different plane of existence. This works like the {@spell plane shift} spell, except the drake can affect only itself and can't use this action to banish an unwilling creature to another plane.

**Plane-Altered Breath {@recharge 5}.** The drake exhales raw magic in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 ({@damage 10d10}) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
