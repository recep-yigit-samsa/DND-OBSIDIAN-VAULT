**Multiattack.** The kelpie makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d8 + 2}) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 12}).

**Drowning Hypnosis.** The kelpie chooses one humanoid it can see within 150 feet of it. If the target can see the kelpie, the target must succeed on a {@dc 11} Wisdom saving throw or be magically {@condition charmed} while the kelpie maintains {@status concentration}, up to 10 minutes (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). The {@condition charmed} target is {@condition incapacitated}, and instead of holding its breath underwater, it tries to breathe normally and immediately runs out of breath, unless it can breathe water. If the {@condition charmed} target is more than 5 feet away from the kelpie, the target must move on its turn toward the kelpie by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks. Before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the kelpie or drowning, the target can repeat the saving throw. A {@condition charmed} target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it. A target that successfully saves is immune to this kelpie's hypnosis for the next 24 hours.
