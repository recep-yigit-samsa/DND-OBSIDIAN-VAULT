**Multiattack.** Belial makes three attacks using his Ranseur of Torture.

**Ranseur of Torture.** {@atk mw} {@hit 18} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}21 ({@damage 2d10 + 10}) piercing damage plus 5 ({@damage 1d10}) necrotic damage, and the target must make a {@dc 23} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target's movement speed is reduced by 5 feet until the end of their next turn. This penalty can stack.

**Walls of Phlegethos.** Belial creates a wall of fire on a solid surface within 120 feet of him. The wall is 20 feet high and 1 foot thick, and Belial can make the wall up to 60 feet long or create a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter. The wall is opaque and lasts until Belial dismisses it. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a {@dc 25} Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 ({@damage 8d8}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn inside the wall, or within 5 feet of it, must repeat the save.

**Symbol of Insanity {@recharge 4}.** Belial draws a magic symbol at a point he can see within 120 feet of him. All creatures within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the symbol must make a {@dc 25} Intelligence saving throw. Targets take 45 ({@damage 10d8}) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail the save immediately use their reaction to make a melee attack against a random creature within their reach, then move their full movement in a random direction.
