**Multiattack.** The mavka makes two Enervating Slam attacks or three Necrotic Bolt attacks. If she is riding a nightmare, the nightmare can then make one Hooves attack. If both Enervating Slam attacks hit one creature, the mavka regains hp equal to the total necrotic damage dealt by both attacks.

**Enervating Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}23 ({@damage 4d8 + 5}) bludgeoning damage plus 16 ({@damage 3d10}) necrotic damage.

**Necrotic Bolt.** {@atk rs} {@hit 8} to hit, range 60 ft., one target. {@h}26 ({@damage 4d10 + 4}) necrotic damage.

**Flame Burst {@recharge 5}.** While riding a nightmare, the mavka channels her power into her mount, causing its fiery light to burn those nearby. Each creature within 20 feet of the mavka must make a {@dc 16} Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 ({@damage 12d8}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
