**Multiattack.** The devil makes three attacks, using Searing Fork or Hurl Flame in any combination. It can replace one attack with a use of Infernal Tail.

**Searing Fork.** {@atkr m} {@hit 10}, reach 10 ft. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d8 + 6}) Piercing damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) Fire damage.

**Hurl Flame.** {@atkr r} {@hit 8}, range 150 ft. {@h}26 ({@damage 5d8 + 4}) Fire damage. If the target is a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it starts burning.

**Infernal Tail.** {@actSave dex} {@dc 17}, one creature the devil can see within 10 feet. {@actSaveFail} 10 ({@damage 1d8 + 6}) Necrotic damage, and the target receives an infernal wound if it doesn't have one. While wounded, the target loses 10 ({@dice 3d6}) {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} at the start of each of its turns. The wound closes after 1 minute, after a spell restores {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} to the target, or after the target or a creature within 5 feet of it takes an action to stanch the wound, doing so by succeeding on a {@dc 17} Wisdom ({@skill Medicine|XPHB}) check.
