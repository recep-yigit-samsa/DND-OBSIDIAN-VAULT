**Multiattack.** The living spell makes two Magical Strike attacks.

**Magical Strike.** {@atk ms} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@dice 5d6 + 5}) poison damage.

**Spell Mimicry {@recharge 5}.** The living spell creates a 40-foot-diameter sphere of fog within 60 feet of it (the fog spreads around corners). When a creature enters the fog for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a {@dc 16} Constitution saving throw, taking 22 ({@damage 5d8}) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fog moves 10 feet away from the living spell at the start of each of its turns, rolling along the ground and through openings. The fog lasts for 10 minutes or until the living spell's {@status concentration} ends (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell).
