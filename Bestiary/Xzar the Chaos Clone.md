**Multiattack.** Xzar makes two Deprive attacks and uses Spellcasting.

**Deprive.** {@atk ms,rs} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., or range 120 ft., one target. {@h}27 ({@damage 4d10 + 5}) necrotic damage.

**Death Eruption (1/Day).** Negative energy erupts from Xzar, intensified by the Chaos Phage. Any creature in a 60-foot-radius sphere around Xzar (but not including Xzar) must make a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 36 ({@damage 8d6}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Humanoid killed by this ability rises at the start of Xzar's next turn as a zombie under his command.
