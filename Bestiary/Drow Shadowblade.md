**Multiattack.** The drow makes two attacks with its shadow sword. If either attack hits and the target is within 10 feet of a 5-foot cube of darkness created by the shadow sword on a previous turn, the drow can dismiss that darkness and cause the target to take 21 ({@damage 6d6}) necrotic damage. The drow can dismiss darkness in this way no more than once per turn.

**Shadow Sword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d6 + 5}) piercing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage and 10 ({@damage 3d6}) poison damage. The drow can then fill an unoccupied 5-foot cube within 5 feet of the target with magical darkness, which remains for 1 minute.

**Hand Crossbow.** {@atk rw} {@hit 9} to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d6 + 5}) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also {@condition unconscious} while {@condition poisoned} in this way. The target regains consciousness if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it.
