**Multiattack.** The salt devil makes two Scimitar attacks and one Water-Draining Claw attack.

**Scimitar.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) slashing damage.

**Water-Draining Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d4 + 4}) slashing damage. If the target is a creature that isn't a Construct or Undead, it must make a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw, taking 14 ({@damage 4d6}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Plants, Oozes, and creatures with the Amphibious, Water Breathing, or Water Form traits have disadvantage on this saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target also suffers one level of {@condition exhaustion}.

**Teleport (3/Day).** The salt devil magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
