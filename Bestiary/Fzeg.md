**Multiattack.** The fzeg uses its howl, then attacks once with its bite and twice with its claws.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) piercing damage plus 17 ({@damage 5d6}) necrotic damage and is {@condition stunned} until the end of its next turn. A humanoid slain after being bitten rises the following night as a fzeglaich under the fzeg's control.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) slashing damage.

**Howl.** Each creature of the fzeg's choice that is within 300 feet of the fzeg and able to hear it must succeed on a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the fzeg's Howl for the next 24 hours or until it is {@condition stunned} by the fzeg.

**Night Children (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The fzeg magically calls eight wolves. These wolves arrive in 2 rounds, acting as allies of the fzeg and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the fzeg dies, or until the fzeg dismisses them as a bonus action.
