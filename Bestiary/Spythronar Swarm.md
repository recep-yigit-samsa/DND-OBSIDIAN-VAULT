### Actions:

| Ability | Damage | Save DC & Type | On Successful Save |

| Bites | 4d4 + 2d8 + 2d4 + 1d8 | - | - |
| Weave (4/Day) | - | 10 | - |


**Bites.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. {@h}10 ({@damage 4d4}) piercing damage and 9 ({@damage 2d8}) lightning damage, or 5 ({@damage 2d4}) piercing damage and 4 ({@damage 1d8}) lightning damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.

**Weave (4/Day).** The spythronar swarm weaves webbing, covering a 5-foot square. The swarm can then give up 1 hit point to create a spythronar sac in that space. If the swarm's webbing covers a 10-foot square, it can give up 23 hit points as part of the same action, creating a spythronar web with the same number of hit points. The swarm can't drop to 0 hit points to create a sac or web. If the swarm weaves an incomplete web, that web is a normal web rather than a sentient, monstrous one. A creature that enters this normal web's space must succeed on a {@dc 10} Strength saving throw or become {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 10}) and {@condition restrained} while {@condition grappled} in this way. Each 5-foot square of this web has AC 10; the damage vulnerabilities, immunities, and resistances of a spythronar web; and 5 hit points.
