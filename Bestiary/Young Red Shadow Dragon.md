**Multiattack.** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d10 + 6}) piercing damage plus 3 ({@damage 1d6}) necrotic damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d6 + 6}) slashing damage.

**Shadow Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales shadowy fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 ({@damage 16d6}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies, and an undead {@creature shadow} rises from its corpse and acts immediately after the dragon in the initiative count. The shadow is under the dragon's control.
