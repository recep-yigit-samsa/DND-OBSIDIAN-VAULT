**Swarm of Bites.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. {@h}21 ({@damage 6d6}) piercing damage, or 10 ({@damage 3d6}) piercing damage if the swarm has half its hit points or fewer.

**Desolate Drain {@recharge 5}.** Each creature in the swarm's space must make a {@dc 13} Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 24 ({@damage 7d6}) psychic damage and is {@condition stunned} until the end of its next turn. The effect ends on a creature if the swarm moves out of the creature's space or if another creature within 5 feet of the swarm uses an action to make a {@dc 14} Strength check, pulling the affected creature out of the swarm on a successful check. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.
