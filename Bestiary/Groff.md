**Multiattack.** The groff makes one Bite attack and one Swamp Claw attack.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 1d8 + 5}) piercing damage.

**Swamp Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d6 + 5}) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 15} Strength saving throw or become engulfed by the groff. While engulfed, the target can't breathe, is {@condition restrained}, and takes 10 ({@damage 3d6}) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. When the groff moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The groff can have only one target engulfed at a time. An engulfed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns. On a success, the target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied space.
