**Multiattack.** The specter makes two scythe attacks.

**Scythe.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) slashing damage plus 13 ({@damage 3d8}) psychic damage.

**Mind Twist {@recharge 5}.** The specter magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw or take 22 ({@damage 5d8}) psychic damage and be {@condition stunned} for 1 minute. The {@condition stunned} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Reap Memory (3/Day).** The specter touches one {@condition incapacitated} creature and chooses 1 hour from among the past 24. Unless the creature succeeds on a {@dc 15} Intelligence saving throw, the creature loses all memory of that hour. The creature regains the memory only if the specter dies within the next 24 hours.
