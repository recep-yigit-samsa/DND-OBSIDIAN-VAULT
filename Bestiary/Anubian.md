**Multiattack.** The anubian makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) slashing damage.

**Haboob (1/Day).** A 30-foot-tall cylinder of sand forms in the anubian's space and moves with it for 10 minutes, until the anubian ends the storm as a bonus action, or until its {@status concentration} ends (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). The area within 5 feet of the anubian is heavily obscured. A creature that starts its turn in that area or enters the area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a {@dc 13} Strength saving throw or be {@condition restrained} by the storm. While {@condition restrained}, the creature takes 3 ({@damage 1d6}) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns, and moves with the anubian when the anubian moves. A creature, including the {@condition restrained} creature, can use its action to free the {@condition restrained} creature by succeeding on a {@dc 13} Strength check.
