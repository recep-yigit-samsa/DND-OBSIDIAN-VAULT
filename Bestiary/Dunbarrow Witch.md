**Multiattack.** The witch makes two Poison Dagger attacks. It can replace one of these attacks with Spellcasting.

**Poison Dagger.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}4 ({@damage 1d4 + 2}) piercing damage plus 21 ({@damage 6d6}) poison damage.

**Polymorph Concoction (1/Day).** The witch hurls a bottle of liquid at a point up to 20 feet away from itself, which shatters into a cloud of magical smoke that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must succeed on a {@dc 16} Wisdom saving throw or transform into a creature, as if under the effects of a {@spell polymorph} spell, transforming into one of the following forms (roll a {@dice d4}): 1, bat; 2, frog; 3, lizard; or 4, rat. This transformation lasts for 1 hour or until the creature drops to 0 hit points in its new form.

**Shattered Shards.** The witch targets a point it can see within 30 feet of itself. The air there magically solidifies into a mirrorlike pane, then shatters in a 15-foot cone originating from that point. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 16} Dexterity saving throw, taking 25 ({@damage 10d4}) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
