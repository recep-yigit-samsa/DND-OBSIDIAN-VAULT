**Multiattack.** Rimmon makes four Sharpened Tongue or Wordplay attacks.

**Sharpened Tongue.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 3d4 + 4}) slashing damage.

**Wordplay.** {@atk rs} {@hit 14} to hit, range 60 ft., one target. {@h}35 ({@damage 6d8 + 8}) psychic damage.

**Connected Clauses (1/Day).** Rimmon emits a burst of energy that arcs towards a creature he can see within 150 feet of him. Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three other targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target must make a {@dc 22} Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 ({@damage 14d8}) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type inflicted is of a type the first target is most vulnerable to.
