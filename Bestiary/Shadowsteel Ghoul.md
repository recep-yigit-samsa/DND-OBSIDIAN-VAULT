**Multiattack.** The Shadowsteel ghoul makes two claw attacks.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) slashing damage and 5 ({@damage 2d4}) necrotic damage. A cursed target must make an escalation check. If a target drops to 0 hit points due to this damage and isn't already cursed, roll {@dice 1d4}, and the target is afflicted with a curse based on the result: 1-2 Curse of Damned Aging, 3-4 Curse of Foul Blight. (See Grim Hollow Campaign Guide for information on curses and escalation.)
