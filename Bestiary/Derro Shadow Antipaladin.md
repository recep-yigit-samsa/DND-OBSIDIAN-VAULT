**Multiattack.** The derro makes two Scimitar or Heavy Crossbow attacks.

**Scimitar.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) slashing damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage.

**Heavy Crossbow.** {@atk rw} {@hit 7} to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 1d10 + 4}) piercing damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage.

**Infectious Insanity {@recharge 5}.** The shadow antipaladin magically assaults the minds of up to three creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must make a {@dc 13} Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 ({@damage 6d6}) psychic damage and is {@condition incapacitated} for 1 minute as its mind fills with thoughts of eldritch terrors and otherworldly entities. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't {@condition incapacitated}. An {@condition incapacitated} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
