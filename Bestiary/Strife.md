**Multiattack.** The strife can use its Sow Discord. It then makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft. one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d6 + 5}) slashing damage.

**Sow Discord.** The strife attempts to sow discord in up to two creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must make a {@dc 13} Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 7 ({@damage 2d6}) psychic damage and distrusts its allies until the start of the strife's next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn't distrust its allies. A creature that distrusts its allies can't give or receive aid from its allies, including spells, class features like Sneak Attack, and the Help action.

**Invisibility.** The strife magically turns {@condition invisible} until it attacks or until its {@status concentration} ends (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). Any equipment the strife wears or carries is {@condition invisible} with it.
