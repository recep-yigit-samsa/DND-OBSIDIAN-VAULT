**Multiattack.** The firegaunt makes two Heated Maul attacks.

**Heated Maul.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}23 ({@damage 3d10 + 7}) bludgeoning damage. The firegaunt can cause the maul to erupt with crimson flames, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw or take 10 ({@damage 3d6}) fire damage and 10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage. The maul can erupt with flames in this way only once per turn.

**Crimson Rays {@recharge 5}.** The firegaunt emits beams of fire from its eyes, mouth, and wounds in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw, taking 31 ({@damage 7d8}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a success or failure, that creature catches fire. Until the burning creature or another creature that can reach it takes an action to extinguish the fire, the burning creature can't regain hit points and takes 5 ({@damage 1d10}) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
