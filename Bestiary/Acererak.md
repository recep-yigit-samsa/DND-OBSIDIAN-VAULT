**Invoke Curse.** While holding the Staff of the Forgotten One, Acererak expends 1 charge from it and targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of him.

Until the curse is ended, the target can't regain hit points and has vulnerability to necrotic damage. {@spell Greater restoration}, {@spell remove curse}, or similar magic ends the curse on the target.
