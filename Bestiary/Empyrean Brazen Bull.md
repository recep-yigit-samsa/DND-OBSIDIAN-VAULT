**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target., {@h}24 ({@damage 3d10 + 8}) bludgeoning damage plus 18 ({@damage 4d8}) radiant damage. If the target is a creature, it is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 20}). Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained}, and the Empyrean brazen bull can't bite another target.

**Gore.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}27 ({@damage 3d12 + 8}) piercing damage and 18 ({@damage 4d8}) radiant damage.

**Hooves.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 5 feet., one target. {@h}24 ({@damage 3d10 + 8}) bludgeoning damage and 18 ({@damage 4d8}) radiant damage.

**Swallow.** The Empyrean brazen bull makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is {@condition blinded} and {@condition restrained}, it has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects outside the Empyrean brazen bull, and it takes 21 ({@damage 6d6}) fire damage at the start of each of theEmpyrean brazen bull's turns. If the Empyrean brazen bull takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the Empyrean brazen bull must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall {@condition prone} in a space within 10 feet of the empyrean brazen bull. If the Empyrean brazen bull dies, a swallowed creature is no longer {@condition restrained} by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting {@condition prone}.
