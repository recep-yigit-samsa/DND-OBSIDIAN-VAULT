**Multiattack.** Aphemia makes two attacks: one with her bite and one with her claws.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 2d4 + 3}) piercing damage plus 13 ({@damage 3d8}) necrotic damage.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) slashing damage.

**Discordant Song.** Aphemia shrieks a cacophony of magical sounds. Each humanoid within 120 feet of her must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} of her until the song ends. A {@condition frightened} creature takes 7 ({@damage 2d6}) psychic damage at the start of its turn while Aphemia is singing. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Aphemia's Discordant Song for the next 24 hours. Aphemia must take a bonus action on her subsequent turns to continue singing. She can stop singing at any time. The song ends if Aphemia is {@condition incapacitated} or dies.

**Grave Calling Song.** Aphemia intones a low, growling magical melody. Every undead within 300 feet of her must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or fall under her control until the song ends. Aphemia must take a bonus action on her subsequent turns to continue singing, and she can mentally command the undead under her control as part of the same bonus action. She can stop singing at any time. The song ends if Aphemia is {@condition incapacitated} or dies.
