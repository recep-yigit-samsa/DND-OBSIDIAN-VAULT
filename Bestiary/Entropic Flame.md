**Hurl Flame.** {@atk rw} {@hit 6} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 3d6}) fire damage.

**Touch.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 5 ({@damage 1d10}) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
