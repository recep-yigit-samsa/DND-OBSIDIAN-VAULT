**Multiattack.** The giant makes two Battleaxe attacks and one Harpoon attack.

**Battleaxe.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}19 ({@damage 3d8 + 6}) slashing damage, or 22 ({@damage 3d10 + 6}) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) cold damage.

**Harpoon.** {@atk rw} {@hit 7} to hit, range 50/200 ft., one creature. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d10 + 3}) piercing damage, and the target has the {@condition grappled} condition (escape {@dc 16}). While the target is {@condition grappled} this way, its speed isn't reduced, but it can't move farther from the giant. The target takes 5 ({@damage 1d10}) slashing damage if it escapes from the grapple or if it tries and fails. The giant can grapple only one target at a time with its harpoon.
