**Multiattack.** The caustic charger makes two Ram attacks. It can replace one Ram attack with a Tentacles attack.

**Ram.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@damage 4d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 15} Strength saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}. If the charger moved at least 10 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw.

**Tentacles.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) bludgeoning damage plus 14 ({@damage 4d6}) acid damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition paralyzed} for 1 minute. The {@condition paralyzed} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the caustic charger attacks a target that is not in the charger's space, the target takes half the acid damage and has advantage on the saving throw.
