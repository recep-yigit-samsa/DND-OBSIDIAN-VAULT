**Multiattack.** The giant makes three attacks using Greataxe, Freezing Ray, or a combination of them.

**Greataxe.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@damage 3d10 + 6}) slashing damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) cold damage.

**Freezing Ray.** {@atk rs} {@hit 10} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 3d8 + 4}) cold damage, and the target must make a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the {@condition restrained} condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.

**Ice Wolves (Requires Frost Rune).** The giant magically summons {@dice 1d4} wolves made of ice (use the {@creature winter wolf} stat block in the Monster Manual to represent them, but they are Elementals instead of Monstrosities). The wolves appear in unoccupied spaces the giant can see within 30 feet of itself. The wolves take their turn immediately after the giant on the same initiative count, and they obey the giant's commands. The wolves gain a +6 bonus to their attack and damage rolls while they are within 30 feet of the giant. The wolves disappear after 1 minute, when the giant dies, or when the giant uses this action again.
