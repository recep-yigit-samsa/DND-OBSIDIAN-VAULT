**Multiattack.** The kraken makes two tentacle attacks, each of which it can replace with one use of Fling.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 3d8 + 7}) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature {@condition grappled} by the kraken, that creature is swallowed and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is {@condition blinded} and {@condition restrained}, it has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 21 ({@damage 6d6}) acid damage at the start of each of the kraken's turns. One Medium or two smaller creatures can be swallowed at the same time. If the kraken takes 35 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a {@dc 23} Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall {@condition prone} in spaces within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer {@condition restrained} by it and can escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement, exiting {@condition prone}.

**Tentacle.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 3d6 + 7}) bludgeoning damage, and the target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 20}). Until the grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained}. The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

**Fling.** One Medium or smaller object held or creature {@condition grappled} by the kraken is thrown up to 40 feet in a random direction and knocked {@condition prone}. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 ({@damage 1d6}) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a {@dc 13} Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked {@condition prone}.

**Lightning Strike.** The kraken magically create a bolt of lightning, which can strike a target the kraken can see within 90 feet of it. The target must make a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 ({@damage 4d10}) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
