**Multiattack.** The volguloth makes two Claw attacks. If both Claw attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 13}), and the volguloth uses its Enshroud on the target.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 2d4 + 3}) slashing damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) poison damage.

**Enshroud.** The volguloth enshrouds a Medium or smaller target {@condition grappled} by it. The enshrouded target is {@condition blinded}, {@condition restrained}, and unable to breathe or speak until the grapple ends. If the volguloth moves, the enshrouded target moves with it. The volguloth can have only one creature enshrouded at a time, and it can't use its Glide trait while enshrouding a creature.
