**Multiattack.** The qwyllion makes three Claw or Deadly Gaze attacks. If two Deadly Gaze attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition incapacitated} until the end of its next turn.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 3d8 + 5}) slashing damage.

**Deadly Gaze.** {@atk rs} {@hit 6} to hit, range 60 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 4d6 + 3}) psychic damage. A Humanoid slain by this attack rises 8 hours later as a specter under the qwyllion's control, unless the Humanoid is restored to life. The qwyllion can have no more than ten specters under its control at one time.

**Charm.** One Humanoid or Beast the qwyllion can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw or be magically {@condition charmed} for 1 day. The {@condition charmed} target obeys the qwyllion's verbal commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to the qwyllion's Charm for the next 24 hours. The qwyllion can have no more than one Humanoid and up to three Beasts {@condition charmed} at a time. If it charms another Humanoid or a fourth Beast, the oldest effect on a previous target ends.
