**Multiattack.** The fate eater makes two Bite attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) slashing damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) necrotic damage.

**Alter Fate {@recharge 5}.** The fate eater alters the fate of one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The creature must make a {@dc 15} Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 36 ({@damage 8d8}) psychic damage, and its fate is altered. Roll a {@dice d6} to determine which of the following alterations affects the creature. On a success, the creature takes half the damage, and its fate isn't altered. A creature with an altered fate for 1 minute or less can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, a creature with an altered fate can repeat the saving throw at the end of each long rest, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**2 Lost Potential.** One of the creature's ability scores, chosen at random, is reduced by 2.

**3 Seeing the Alternates.** The creature is {@condition incapacitated} for 1 minute.

**4 Shifting Memories.** The creature loses proficiency in one random skill and gains proficiency in another random skill.

**5 Took the Lesser Path.** The creature's current hp total becomes its hp maximum.

**6 Untied from the Loop.** When the creature moves, it moves in a random direction for 1 minute.
