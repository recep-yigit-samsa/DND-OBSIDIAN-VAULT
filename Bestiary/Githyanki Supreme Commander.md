**Multiattack.** The githyanki makes two greatsword attacks.

**Silver Greatsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d6 + 7}) slashing damage plus 17 ({@damage 5d6}) psychic damage. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as with the {@spell astral projection} spell), the githyanki can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.
