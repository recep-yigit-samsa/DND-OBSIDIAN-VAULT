**Multiattack.** The reigar makes two Trident attacks.

**Trident.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) piercing damage, or 8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 3 ({@damage 1d6}) force damage if the reigar is wearing its talarith.

**Chromatic Bolt.** {@atk rs} {@hit 10} to hit, range 90 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@damage 5d8}) damage of a type chosen by the reigar from the following list: cold, fire, lightning, or radiant.

**Summon Duplicate (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** Using its talarith, the reigar summons a duplicate of itself. The duplicate obeys the reigar's commands and uses the reigar's statistics, except it is an unaligned Construct that doesn't have a talarith of its own. The duplicate takes its turn immediately after the reigar. It vanishes after 1 hour or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.
