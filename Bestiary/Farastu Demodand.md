**Multiattack.** The farastu makes two Claw attacks and one Bite attack.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d10 + 5}) slashing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the {@condition grappled} condition (escape {@dc 15}, with disadvantage). The farastu has two claws, each of which can grapple one creature.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit (with advantage against a creature the farastu is grappling), reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) piercing damage plus 24 ({@damage 7d6}) acid damage.

**Summon Demodand (1/Day).** The farastu has a 40 percent chance of summoning 1 farastu demodand. A summoned demodand appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the farastu, acts as an ally of the farastu, and can't summon other demodands. It remains for 1 minute, until it or the farastu dies, or until the farastu dismisses it as an action.
