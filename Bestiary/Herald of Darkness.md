**Multiattack.** The herald of darkness makes two Embrace Darkness or Shadow Sword attacks.

**Embrace Darkness (Shadow Form Only).** {@atk ms} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the herald's space. {@h}18 ({@damage 3d8 + 5}) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition paralyzed} until the end of its next turn.

**Shadow Sword (Fiend Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d8 + 5}) slashing damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage.

**Majesty of the Abyss {@recharge 5}.** The herald of darkness emits a sinister burst of infernal power. Each creature within 15 feet of the herald and that can see it must make a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 27 ({@damage 6d8}) necrotic damage and is {@condition blinded} for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't {@condition blinded}. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is also {@condition paralyzed} until the end of its next turn. A {@condition blinded} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
