**Multiattack.** The son of Fenris makes one Bite attack and two Slam attacks, or it makes four Divine Bolt attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}19 ({@damage 2d10 + 8}) piercing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage or ({@damage 3d6}) radiant damage (the son's choice). If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the son of Fenris. A swallowed creature is {@condition blinded} and {@condition restrained}, it has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects outside the son, and it takes 21 ({@damage 6d6}) acid damage at the start of each of the son's turns. The son can have only one creature swallowed at a time. If the son takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the son must succeed on a {@dc 20} Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls {@condition prone} in a space within 10 feet of the son. If the son dies, the swallowed creature is no longer {@condition restrained} by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting {@condition prone}.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 1d10 + 8}) bludgeoning damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage or ({@damage 3d6}) radiant damage (the son's choice).

**Divine Bolt.** {@atk rs} {@hit 8} to hit, range 60 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 4d6 + 4}) necrotic damage or ({@damage 4d6 + 4}) radiant damage (the son's choice).

**Snake Breath {@recharge 5}.** The two snake tongues of the son of Fenris each exhale poison in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide, resulting in two lines. Each creature in a line must make a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 ({@damage 10d8}) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the lines overlap, each creature in the overlapping lines must make one saving throw with disadvantage against only one of the lines rather than one saving throw for each line.
