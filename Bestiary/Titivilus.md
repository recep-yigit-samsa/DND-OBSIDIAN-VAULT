**Multiattack.** Titivilus makes one sword attack and uses his Frightful Word once.

**Silver Sword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) slashing damage plus 16 ({@damage 3d10}) necrotic damage, or 9 ({@damage 1d10 + 4}) slashing damage plus 16 ({@damage 3d10}) necrotic damage if used with two hands. If the target is a creature, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to half the necrotic damage it takes.

**Frightful Word.** Titivilus targets one creature he can see within 10 feet of him. The target must succeed on a {@dc 21} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. While {@condition frightened} in this way, the target must take the Dash action and move away from Titivilus by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move, in which case it needn't take the Dash action. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Teleport.** Titivilus magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

**Twisting Words.** Titivilus targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. The target must make a {@dc 21} Charisma saving throw. On a failure the target is {@condition charmed} for 1 minute. The {@condition charmed} target can repeat the saving throw if Titivilus deals any damage to it. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to Titivilus's Twisting Words for 24 hours.
