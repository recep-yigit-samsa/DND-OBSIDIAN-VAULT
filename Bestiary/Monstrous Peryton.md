**Multiattack.** The peryton makes two attacks: one with its gore and one with its talons.

**Gore.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) piercing damage.

**Talons.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d10 + 5}) slashing damage.

**Warp Shadow.** The peryton chooses up to three creatures within 60 feet of it that it can see. Each creature must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or become cursed. While cursed, whenever the creature makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, it must roll a {@dice d4} and subtract that number from the roll. A cursed creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this peryton's Warp Shadow for 24 hours.
