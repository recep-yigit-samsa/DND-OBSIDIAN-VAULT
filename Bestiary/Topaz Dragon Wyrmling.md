**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d10 + 2}) piercing damage plus 2 ({@damage 1d4}) necrotic damage.

**Desiccating Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales yellowish necrotic energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 11} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 21 ({@damage 6d6}) necrotic damage and is weakened until the end of its next turn. A weakened creature has disadvantage on Strength-based ability checks and Strength saving throws, and the creature's weapon attacks that rely on Strength deal half damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't weakened.
