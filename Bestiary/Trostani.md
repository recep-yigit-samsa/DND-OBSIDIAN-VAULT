**Multiattack.** Trostani takes three actions: she uses Constrict and Touch of Order, and she casts a spell with a casting time of 1 action.

**Constrict.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}15 ({@damage 3d6 + 5}) bludgeoning damage, and the target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 19}). Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained}. Trostani can grapple no more than three targets at a time.

**Touch of Order.** {@atk ms} {@hit 16} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}23 ({@damage 3d8 + 10}) radiant damage, and Trostani can choose one magic item she can see in the target's possession. Unless it's an artifact, the item's magic is suppressed until the start of Trostani's next turn.

**Wrath of Mat'Selesnya {@recharge 5}.** Trostani conjures a momentary whirl of branches and vines at a point she can see within 60 feet of her. Each creature in a 30-foot cube on that point must make a {@dc 24} Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 ({@damage 6d6}) bludgeoning damage and 21 ({@damage 6d6}) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
