**Multiattack.** Abigor makes four attacks using its Warhammer, Throwing Hammer, or a combination of the two.

**Warhammer.** {@atk mw} {@hit 15} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d8 + 8}) bludgeoning damage plus 3 ({@damage 1d6}) thunder damage.

**Throwing Hammer.** {@atk rw} {@hit 15} to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d8 + 8}) bludgeoning damage plus 3 ({@damage 1d6}) thunder damage. Hammers thrown this way fall and stick into the ground after hitting their target and a new hammer appears in Abigor's hand.

**Thunderous Slam {@recharge 5}.** Abigor causes all its hammers left on the battlefield to bristle with thunderous energy, exploding outwards with a roar. All creatures within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on each hammer must make a {@dc 22} Constitution saving throw. Targets take 26 ({@damage 4d12}) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature is within multiple spheres, it must make the save multiple times, taking damage from each source.
