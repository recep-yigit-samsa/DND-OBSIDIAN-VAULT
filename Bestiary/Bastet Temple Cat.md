**Multiattack.** The temple cat makes one Bite attack and one Claws attack.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d4 + 4}) piercing damage.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 2d4 + 4}) slashing damage.

**Fascinating Purr.** The temple cat purrs loudly at a Humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it and that can hear it. The target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition charmed}. While {@condition charmed} by the temple cat, the target is {@condition incapacitated} and must move on its turn toward the cat by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet of the cat and pet or hold it. The target doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the cat, the target can repeat the saving throw. A {@condition charmed} target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the temple cat's Fascinating Purr for the next 24 hours. The temple cat has advantage on attack rolls against any creature petting or holding it.
