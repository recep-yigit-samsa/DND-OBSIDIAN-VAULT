**Multiattack.** Murgaxor makes two Blood Lash attacks.

**Blood Lash.** {@atk ms} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}21 ({@damage 3d10 + 5}) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it can't regain hit points until the start of Murgaxor's next turn.

**Blood Boil {@recharge 4}.** Murgaxor chooses a point within 150 feet of himself, and a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point fills with a burst of searing, blood-red mist. Each creature of Murgaxor's choice that he can see in that area must make a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 38 ({@damage 7d10}) necrotic damage and is {@condition incapacitated} until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition incapacitated}. A creature dies if reduced to 0 hit points by this necrotic damage.
