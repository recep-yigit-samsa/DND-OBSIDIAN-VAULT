**Multiattack.** The medusa makes two claw attacks. It can also use Petrifying Gaze before or after making these attacks.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) slashing damage.

**Petrifying Gaze.** The medusa fixes its gaze on one creature within 60 feet of it that it can see and that can see its eyes. The target must make a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly {@condition petrified}. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is {@condition restrained}. The {@condition restrained} creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming {@condition petrified} on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by a {@spell greater restoration} spell or similar magic.
