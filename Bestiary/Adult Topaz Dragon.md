**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d10 + 4}) piercing damage plus 3 ({@damage 1d6}) necrotic damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) slashing damage.

**Desiccating Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales yellowish necrotic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 35 ({@damage 10d6}) necrotic damage and is weakened until the end of its next turn. A weakened creature has disadvantage on Strength-based ability checks and Strength saving throws, and the creature's weapon attacks that rely on Strength deal half damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't weakened.
