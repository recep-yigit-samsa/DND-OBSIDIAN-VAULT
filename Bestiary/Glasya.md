**Multiattack.** Glasya makes four attacks using Scourge of Shadow, Necrotic Grasp, or a combination of the two. She can replace one of the attacks with Mesmerizing Gaze.

**Scourge of Shadow.** {@atk mw} {@hit 20} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}19 ({@damage 3d4 + 12}) slashing damage, plus 5 ({@damage 2d4}) necrotic damage. This attack scores a critical on a roll of 18, 19, or 20.

**Necrotic Grasp.** Glasya summons necrotic hands to grope and claw at a creature she can see within 90 feet of her. The target must make a {@dc 25} Constitution saving throw, taking 20 ({@damage 2d10 + 9}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Mesmerizing Gaze.** Glasya focuses her gaze in a 60-foot cone in front of her. Each creature of her choice within the cone must make a {@dc 23} Charisma saving throw or have the {@condition charmed} condition until the end of their next turn. While {@condition charmed}, creatures automatically fail saving throws from abilities used by Glasya and move to be as close to her as possible.

**Deathly Exclamation (1/Day).** Glasya targets a creature she can see within 60 feet of her. The target must make a {@dc 25} Constitution saving throw, taking 61 ({@damage 7d8 + 30}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Humanoid killed by this ability rises at the start of Glasya's next turn as a zombie permanently under her command.
