**Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, the duergar magically increases in size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. While enlarged, the duergar is Large, doubles its damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks (included in the attacks), and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage. If the duergar lacks the room to become Large, it attains the maximum size possible in the space available.

**War Pick.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d8 + 2}) piercing damage, or 11 ({@damage 2d8 + 2}) piercing damage while enlarged.

**Javelin.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d6 + 2}) piercing damage, or 9 ({@damage 2d6 + 2}) piercing damage while enlarged.

**Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The duergar magically turns {@condition invisible} until it attacks, casts a spell, or uses its Enlarge, or until its {@status concentration} is broken, up to 1 hour (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). Any equipment the duergar wears or carries is {@condition invisible} with it.
