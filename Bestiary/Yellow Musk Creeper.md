**Touch.** {@atk mw} {@hit 3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}13 ({@damage 3d8}) psychic damage. If the target is a humanoid that drops to 0 hit points as a result of this damage, it dies and is implanted with a yellow musk creeper bulb. Unless the bulb is destroyed, the corpse animates as a yellow musk zombie after being dead for 24 hours. The bulb is destroyed if the creature is raised from the dead before it can transform into a yellow musk zombie, or if the corpse is targeted by a {@spell remove curse} spell or similar magic before it animates.

**Yellow Musk (3/Day).** The creeper's flowers release a strong musk that targets all humanoids within 30 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a {@dc 11} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition charmed} by the creeper for 1 minute. A creature {@condition charmed} in this way does nothing on its turn except move as close as it can to the creeper. A creature {@condition charmed} by the creeper can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
