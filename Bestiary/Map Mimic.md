**Pseudopod.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d6 + 2}) bludgeoning damage, and it attaches to the target. While attached, the mimic can't attack, the target is {@condition blinded}, and at the start of each of the mimic's turns, the target takes 5 ({@damage 1d6 + 2}) bludgeoning damage. The attached mimic moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the mimic's movement. It can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the mimic by succeeding on a {@dc 8} Strength check.
