**Multiattack (Yuan-ti Form Only).** The yuan-ti makes one constrict attack and one scimitar attack.

**Constrict.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) bludgeoning damage, and the target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 14}) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained}, and the yuan-ti can't constrict another target.

**Scimitar (Yuan-ti Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) slashing damage.

**Invoke Nightmare (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The yuan-ti taps into the nightmares of a creature it can see within 60 feet of it and creates an illusory, immobile manifestation of the creature's deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a {@dc 13} Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 11 ({@damage 2d10}) psychic damage and is {@condition frightened} of the manifestation, believing it to be real. The yuan-ti must concentrate to maintain the illusion (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell), which lasts for up to 1 minute and can't be harmed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the illusion on a success, or taking 11 ({@damage 2d10}) psychic damage on a failure.
