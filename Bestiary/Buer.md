**Multiattack.** Buer makes three attacks using her Claw. She can replace two of the attacks with a Cleansing Bite attack.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@damage 3d10 + 6}) slashing damage.

**Cleansing Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}19 ({@damage 2d12 + 6}) bludgeoning damage, healing Buer for an amount equal to the damage dealt.

**Spectral Reaping {@recharge}.** Buer focuses her ethereal form, dashing up to 50 feet in a straight line through the ethereal plane. Any creatures in the line must make a {@dc 21} Constitution saving throw, taking 42 ({@damage 12d6}) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Buer may reappear at any unoccupied space along the line. For 1 minute after using Spectral Reaping, Buer is empowered by ethereal essence. Her Cleansing Bite attack now deals force damage instead of bludgeoning.
