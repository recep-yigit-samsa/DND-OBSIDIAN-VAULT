**Multiattack.** The scion makes one Crystal Club attack and two Slam attacks, then uses Entombing Grasp if available. Alternatively, the scion makes two Runic Boulder attacks.

**Crystal Club.** {@atk mw} {@hit 16} to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. {@h}35 ({@damage 4d12 + 9}) bludgeoning damage. {@hom}The scion can cause the club to flare with bright light, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 22} Constitution saving throw or take 18 ({@damage 4d8}) radiant damage and have the {@condition blinded} condition until the start of the scion's next turn.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 16} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}31 ({@damage 4d10 + 9}) force damage.

**Runic Boulder.** {@atk rw} {@hit 16} to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. {@h}27 ({@damage 4d8 + 9}) bludgeoning damage. {@hom}The boulder explodes. The target and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a {@dc 22} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 19 ({@damage 3d12}) force damage and has the {@condition prone} condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

**Entombing Grasp {@recharge}.** The scion wreathes its hand in petrifying magic and touches one Huge or smaller creature it can see within 20 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a {@dc 24} Dexterity saving throw or take 28 ({@damage 8d6}) force damage and have the {@condition grappled} condition (escape {@dc 19}). At the start of the scion's next turn, if the target is still {@condition grappled}, the target has the {@condition petrified} condition.
