**Multiattack.** Kas makes three Vengeful Sword attacks. He can replace one of these attacks with a Bite attack.

**Vengeful Sword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 15} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 2d8 + 11}) slashing damage. The sword scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 15} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}11 ({@damage 1d6 + 8}) piercing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Kas regains a number of hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. A Humanoid slain in this way and then buried rises the following night as a vampire spawn under Kas's control.
