**Magical Gift (1/Day).** The chwinga targets a humanoid it can see within 5 feet of it. The target gains a {@filter supernatural charm|rewards|type=charm} of the DM's choice. See {@book chapter 7|DMG|7|Other Rewards} of the Dungeon Masters Guide for more information on supernatural charms.

**Natural Shelter.** The chwinga magically takes shelter inside a rock, a living plant, or a natural source of fresh water in its space. The chwinga can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect while inside this shelter, and the shelter doesn't impair the chwinga's blindsight. The chwinga can use its action to emerge from a shelter. If its shelter is destroyed, the chwinga is forced out and appears in the shelter's space, but is otherwise unharmed.
