**Club.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d4 + 3}) bludgeoning damage plus 5 ({@damage 2d4}) poison damage.

**Frightening Mien {@recharge 5}.** The leshy briefly appears to grow to an enormous size, taking on a malicious mien before returning to normal. Each creature within 15 feet of the leshy and that can see it must succeed on a {@dc 13} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature is immune to Frightening Mien if it can see through illusions.

**Encourage Growth (1/Day).** The leshy whispers magical words of growth to nonmagical plants on a point it can see within 30 feet of it. The plants burst with life and spread rapidly. The area within 20 feet of that point becomes difficult terrain for 24 hours.
