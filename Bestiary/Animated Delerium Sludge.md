**Contaminated Touch.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage. In addition, a target hit by this attack must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or gain one {@adventure level of contamination|DoDk|12}.

**Engulf.** Each creature in the animated sludge's space must succeed on a {@dc 15} Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes {@condition grappled} by the sludge if it is Large or smaller (escape {@dc 14}). Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained}. If the saving throw is successful, the target is pushed out of the sludge's space. The sludge can grapple one Large creature or up to two Medium or smaller creatures at one time. At the start of each of the sludge's turns, each target {@condition grappled} by it takes 28 ({@damage 8d6}) necrotic damage and must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or gain one {@adventure level of contamination|DoDk|12}. A creature within 5 feet of the sludge can attempt to pull a creature or object out of it. This takes an action and requires a successful {@dc 14} Strength check.
