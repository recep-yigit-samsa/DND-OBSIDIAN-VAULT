**Crushing Leap.** If the servant jumps at least 25 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures is pushed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the servant and must make a {@dc 25} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 26 ({@damage 4d12}) bludgeoning damage and is knocked {@condition prone}. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked {@condition prone}.
