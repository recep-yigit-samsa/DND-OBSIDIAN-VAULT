**Multiattack.** The horror makes one Bite attack and two Rotating Saw attacks, or it makes two Lightning Jolt attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d8 + 2}) piercing damage.

**Rotating Saw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}4 ({@damage 1d4 + 2}) slashing damage.

**Lightning Jolt.** {@atk rs} {@hit 4} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d10 + 2}) lightning damage.

**Spelljamming Helm Interface.** The horror attaches to a spelljamming helm it can see within 5 feet of itself and attunes to the helm instantly. If another creature is already attuned to the helm, that creature's attunement to the helm ends when the horror's attunement begins. The horror can operate the helm even though it isn't a spellcaster. The horror can detach from the helm as a bonus action, which ends its attunement to the helm.
