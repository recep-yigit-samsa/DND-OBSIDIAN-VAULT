The target must succeed on a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition paralyzed} for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Benign Transposition.** Var teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. Alternatively, he can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, both creatures teleport, swapping places. Var can use this feature again only after he finishes a long rest or casts a conjuration spell of 1st level or higher.
