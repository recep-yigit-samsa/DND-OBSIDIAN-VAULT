**Multiattack.** The dullahan makes two attacks.

**Battleaxe.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) slashing damage, or 9 ({@damage 1d10 + 4}) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 11 ({@damage 2d10}) necrotic damage. If the dullahan scores a critical hit against a creature, the target must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or the dullahan cuts off the target's head. The target dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature that doesn't have or need a head, or has legendary actions, instead takes an extra 27 ({@damage 6d8}) slashing damage.

**Fiery Skull.** {@atk rs} {@hit 7} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d10 + 3}) fire damage.
