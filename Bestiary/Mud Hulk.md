**Enveloping Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 1d12 + 3}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 13} Strength saving throw or be pulled into the mud hulk's space and be engulfed by the mud hulk. While engulfed, the target can't breathe, has the {@condition restrained} condition, and takes 6 ({@damage 1d12}) acid damage at the start of each of its turns. When the mud hulk moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The mud hulk can have only one target engulfed at a time. While a creature is engulfed, the mud hulk can't use its Amorphous trait. An engulfed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied space.

**Mud Splash.** The mud hulk lobs a mass of mud that splashes in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 30 feet of the mud hulk. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 13} Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The affected area is difficult terrain until the start of the mud hulk's next turn.
