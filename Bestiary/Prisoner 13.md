**Multiattack.** Prisoner 13 makes two Tattooed Strike attacks.

**Tattooed Strike.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d8 + 3}) force damage.

**Firestorm Tattoo {@recharge 5}.** Prisoner 13 magically unleashes flame from the tattoo across her back, filling a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on her. Each other creature in that area must make a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 13 ({@damage 3d8}) fire damage and is knocked {@condition prone}. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't knocked {@condition prone}.

**River Tattoo.** Prisoner 13 magically ends any effects causing the {@condition grappled} or {@condition restrained} conditions on herself. If she is bound with nonmagical restraints, she slips out of them.
