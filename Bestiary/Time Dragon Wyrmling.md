**Multiattack.** The dragon makes three Rend attacks.

**Rend.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) slashing damage plus 3 ({@damage 1d6}) force damage.

**Time Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a wave of shimmering light in a 15-foot cone. Nonmagical objects and vegetation in that area that aren't being worn or carried crumble to dust. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 ({@damage 6d8}) force damage and is magically weakened as it is desynchronized from the time stream. While the creature is in this state, attack rolls against it have advantage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A weakened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
