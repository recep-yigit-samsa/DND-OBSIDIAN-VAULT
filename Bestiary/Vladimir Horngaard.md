**Multiattack.** Vladimir makes two fist attacks or two attacks with his +2 Greatsword.

**Fist.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) bludgeoning damage. Strahd, the target of Vladimir's sworn vengeance, takes an extra 14 ({@damage 4d6}) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, Vladimir can grapple the target (escape {@dc 14}) provided the target is Large or smaller.

**Greatsword +2.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 4d6 + 6}) slashing damage. Against Strahd, Vladimir deals an extra 14 ({@damage 4d6}) slashing damage with this weapon.

**Vengeful Glare.** Vladimir can target Strahd within 30 feet provided he can see Strahd. Strahd must make a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw. One a failure, Strahd is {@condition paralyzed} until Vladimir deals damage to him, or until the end of Vladimir's next turn. When the paralysis ends, Strahd is {@condition frightened} of Vladimir for 1 minute. Strahd can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of his turns, with disadvantage if he can see Vladimir, ending the {@condition frightened} condition on itself on a success.
