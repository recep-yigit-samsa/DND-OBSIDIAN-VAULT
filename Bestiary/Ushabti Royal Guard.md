**Multiattack.** The ushabti can use its Breath-Stealing Presence. It then makes two Khopesh attacks and one Medjai's Scepter attack.

**Khopesh.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d6 + 6}) slashing damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage.

**Medjai's Scepter.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d8 + 6}) bludgeoning damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage.

**Breath-Stealing Presence.** Each creature of the ushabti's choice within 30 feet of the ushabti and aware of it must succeed on a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw or take 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage and be unable to speak or breathe for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the ushabti's Breath‑Stealing Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Enervating Surge {@recharge 5}.** The ushabti emits waves of necrotic energy. Each creature within 30 feet of the ushabti must make a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw, taking 49 ({@damage 11d8}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that can't breathe because of the ushabti's Breath‑Stealing Presence has disadvantage on the saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature also suffers one level of {@condition exhaustion}. A Humanoid slain by this effect rises {@dice 1d4} hours later as a mummy under the ushabti's control, unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The ushabti can have no more than five mummies under its control at one time.
