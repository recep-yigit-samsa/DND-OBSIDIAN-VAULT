**Multiattack.** The monolith champion makes one Greatsword attack and one Slam attack.

**Greatsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 4d6 + 4}) slashing damage plus 13 ({@damage 3d8}) cold damage or fire damage (the champion's choice). If the target is within a fey court or castle, the target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Charisma saving throw or become {@condition invisible}, silent, and {@condition paralyzed} for 1 minute, while an illusory version of the target under the champion's control remains visible and audible. The illusion shouts to the target's allies for a retreat or similar action. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself and destroying the illusory double on a success.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) bludgeoning damage plus 13 ({@damage 3d8}) cold damage or fire damage (the champion's choice).
