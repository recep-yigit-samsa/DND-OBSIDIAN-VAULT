**Multiattack.** The tri-flower frond uses its orange blossom, then its yellow blossom, and then its red blossom.

**Orange Blossom.** The tri-flower frond chooses one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a {@dc 11} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, the target is {@condition unconscious}. At the end of each minute, the {@condition poisoned} target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Yellow Blossom.** The tri-flower frond chooses one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a {@dc 11} Dexterity saving throw, or it is covered with corrosive sap and takes 5 acid damage at the start of each of its turns. Dousing the target with water reduces the acid damage by 1 point per pint or flask of water used.

**Red Blossom.** {@atk mw} {@hit 2} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}2 ({@damage 1d4}) piercing damage, and the target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 11}). Until this grapple ends, the target takes 5 ({@damage 2d4}) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The red blossom can grapple only one target at a time. Another creature within reach of the tri-flower frond can use its action to end the grapple on the target.
