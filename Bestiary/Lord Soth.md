**Multiattack.** Soth makes three Forsaken Brand attacks.

**Forsaken Brand.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 1d8 + 6}) bludgeoning damage plus 18 ({@damage 4d8}) necrotic damage, and if the target is a creature, it can't regain hit points until the start of Soth's next turn.

**Cataclysmic Fire (1/Day).** Soth hurls a magical ball of fire that explodes at a point he can see within 120 feet of himself. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a {@dc 19} Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 35 ({@damage 10d6}) fire damage and 35 ({@damage 10d6}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, any Medium or smaller Humanoid killed by this damage, as well as every corpse of such a creature within the sphere, becomes a skeleton (see the Monster Manual) under Soth's control. The skeleton acts on Soth's initiative but immediately after his turn. Absent any other command, the skeleton tries to kill any non-Undead creature it encounters.

**Word of Death (1/Day).** Soth points at a creature he can see within 60 feet of himself and magically commands it to die. The target must make a {@dc 19} Constitution saving throw, taking 100 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target dies.
