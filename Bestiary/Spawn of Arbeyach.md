**Multiattack.** The spawn of Arbeyach makes one Bite attack and one Stinger attack.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) piercing damage plus 4 ({@damage 1d8}) poison damage.

**Stinger.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d4 + 4}) piercing damage plus 13 ({@damage 3d8}) poison damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} for 1 minute. A {@condition poisoned} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Children of Arbeyach (1/Day).** The spawn of Arbeyach magically calls {@dice 1d4} swarms of insects. The called creatures arrive in {@dice 1d4} rounds, acting as allies of the spawn and obeying its spoken commands. The insects remain for 1 hour, until the spawn dies, or until the spawn dismisses them as a bonus action.
