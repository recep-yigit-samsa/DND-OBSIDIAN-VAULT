**Multiattack.** Nafik can use his Dreadful Glare and makes one Rotting Fist or Unholy Beam attack.

**Rotting Fist.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) bludgeoning damage plus 21 ({@damage 6d6}) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 ({@dice 3d6}) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the {@spell Remove Curse} spell or other magic.

**Unholy Beam.** {@atk rs} {@hit 6} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}28 ({@damage 8d6}) necrotic damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of Nafik's next turn has advantage.

**Dreadful Glare.** Nafik targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of himself. The target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or have the {@condition frightened} condition until the end of Nafik's next turn. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to Nafik's Dreadful Glare for the next 24 hours.
