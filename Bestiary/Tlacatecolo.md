**Multiattack.** The tlacatecolo makes two Talon attacks.

**Talon.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d8 + 3}) piercing damage plus 14 ({@damage 3d8}) poison damage.

**Change Shape.** The tlacatecolo magically transforms into a Medium owl, while retaining its game statistics (other than its size). This transformation ends if the tlacatecolo is reduced to 0 hit points or if it uses its action to end it.

**Plague Winds (Fiend Form Only; Recharge 5-6).** The tlacatecolo emits a chilling, disease-ridden wind in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must succeed on a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw or take 26 ({@damage 4d12}) cold damage and become {@condition poisoned}. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, the creature can't regain hit points. At the end of every hour, the creature must succeed on a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of {@condition exhaustion}. If the creature is in direct sunlight when it makes this saving throw, it automatically succeeds on the save. If the creature is targeted by magic that ends a poison or disease, such as lesser restoration, while the creature isn't in direct sunlight, the effect does not end.
