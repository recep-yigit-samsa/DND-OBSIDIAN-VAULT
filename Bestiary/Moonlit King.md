**Multiattack.** The Moonlit King makes three Crystal Staff or Moon Bolt attacks. He can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting. If two Crystal Staff attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a {@dc 19} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition stunned} until the end of its next turn.

**Crystal Staff.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) bludgeoning damage plus 14 ({@damage 4d6}) radiant damage.

**Moon Bolt.** {@atk rs} {@hit 11} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}27 ({@damage 4d10 + 5}) radiant damage, and the target sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius until the end of its next turn. If the target is a creature in a form other than its true form, it takes an extra 11 ({@damage 2d10}) radiant damage and must succeed on a {@dc 19} Charisma saving throw or revert to its true form.

**Animate Shadows {@recharge 5}.** The Moonlit King causes the shadows of up to three creatures he can see within 60 feet of him to animate and attack their owners. Each target must make a {@dc 19} Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 49 ({@damage 14d6}) necrotic damage, and its Strength score is reduced by {@dice 1d4}. On a success, a creature takes half the damage, and its Strength score isn't reduced. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The creature dies if this effect reduces its Strength to 0.

**Summon Devil (1/Day).** The Moonlit King magically calls a lunar devil to aid him. The devil arrives in {@dice 1d4} rounds, acting as ally of the Moonlit King and obeying his spoken commands. The devil remains for 1 hour, until the Moonlit King dies, or until the King dismisses it as a bonus action.
