**Thundering Stone Club.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 3d6 + 6}) bludgeoning damage. The giant can cause the club to emit a burst of thunderous energy that deals 10 ({@damage 3d6}) thunder damage to each creature, other than the giant, within 30 feet of the target. The club can emit a burst this way only once per turn.

**Boulder.** {@atk rw} {@hit 10} to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. {@h}19 ({@damage 3d8 + 6}) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 18} Strength saving throw or have the {@condition prone} condition. After the giant throws the boulder, roll a {@dice d6}; on a roll of 3 or lower, the giant has no more boulders to throw.
