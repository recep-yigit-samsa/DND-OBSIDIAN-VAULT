**Multiattack.** Barbatos makes two bone shortsword attacks.

**Bone Shortsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) piercing damage.

**Light Crossbow.** {@atk rw} {@hit 6} to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d8 + 3}) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also {@condition unconscious}. The target regains consciousness if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it.

**Cloak Sweep.** Barbatos corrodes a nonmagical ferrous metal object he can see within 5 feet of himself. If the object isn't being worn or carried, the touch destroys a 1-foot cube of it. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, the creature can make a {@dc 12} Dexterity saving throw to avoid Barbatos's touch. If the object touched is either metal armor or a metal shield being worn or carried, it takes a permanent and cumulative 1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed. If the object touched is a held metal weapon, it rusts as described in Barbatos's Rust Monster Cloak trait.
