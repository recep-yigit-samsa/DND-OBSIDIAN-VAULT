**Multiattack.** The giff makes two Longsword or Musket attacks.

**Longsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) slashing damage, or 9 ({@damage 1d10 + 4}) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Musket.** {@atk rw} {@hit 4} to hit, range 40/120 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d12 + 2}) piercing damage.

**Force Grenade.** The giff throws a grenade up to 60 feet, and the grenade explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 ({@damage 5d6}) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the giff throws the grenade, roll a {@dice d6}; on a roll of 4 or lower, the giff has no more grenades to throw.
