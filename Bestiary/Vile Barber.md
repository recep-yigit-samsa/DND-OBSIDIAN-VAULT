**Multiattack.** The vile barber makes two Straight Razor attacks. If both attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Dexterity saving throw or lose 3 {@dice 1d6} hp at the start of each of its turns due to a bleeding wound. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful {@dc 12} Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.

**Straight Razor.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vile barber can steal one item the target is wearing or carrying, provided the item weighs no more than 10 pounds, isn't a weapon, and isn't wrapped around or firmly attached to the target, such as a shirt or armor.

**Frightening Cut {@recharge 5}.** The vile barber makes one Straight Razor attack against a creature it can see within 5 feet of it. If the attack hits and deals damage, the target takes an extra 7 ({@damage 2d6}) necrotic damage, and each creature that can see the attack within 15 feet of the target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
