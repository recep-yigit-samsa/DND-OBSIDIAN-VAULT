**Multiattack.** Mephistopheles makes three Ranseur attacks. He can replace one of the attacks with Hellfire Lash (if available).

**Ranseur, +3.** {@atk mw} {@hit 17} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 2d10 + 9}) piercing plus 18 ({@damage 4d8}) fire or cold damage (Mephistopheles' choice).

**Hellfire Implosion {@recharge 4}.** A bright streak of Hellfire appears at a point that Mephistopheles can see within 150 feet of him. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a {@dc 22} Dexterity saving throw. Targets take 31 ({@damage 9d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Hellfire Lash {@recharge 5}.** Mephistopheles unleashes a 60-foot-long, 5-foot-wide lash of Hellfire that ignites a 5-foot-radius sphere around where it strikes. Any targets in the area of effect must make a {@dc 22} Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 ({@damage 8d8}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
