**Multiattack.** The ancient deep crow makes three attacks: one with its mandibles and two with its claws.

**Mandibles.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d10 + 6}) piercing damage, and the target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 19}). Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained}, and the ancient deep crow can't use its mandibles on another target.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d6 + 6}) slashing damage.

**Shadow Caw.** The ancient deep crow releases an ear-splitting caw. Each creature within 60 feet of the crow and able to hear it must make a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 ({@damage 3d6}) psychic damage.
