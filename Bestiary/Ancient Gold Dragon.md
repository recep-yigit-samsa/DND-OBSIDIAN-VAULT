**Weakening Breath.** {@actSave str} {@dc 24}, each creature that isn't currently affected by this breath in a 90-foot {@variantrule Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cone}. {@actSaveFail} The target has {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on Strength-based {@variantrule D20 Test|XPHB|D20 Tests} and subtracts 5 ({@dice 1d10}) from its damage rolls.
