**Multiattack.** Augustus makes any combination of two Bite, Claw, or Magic Longsword attacks.

**Bite (Wolf or Hybrid Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}26 ({@damage 5d8 + 4}) piercing damage. If the target is a Humanoid, it must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or be cursed with lycanthropy. While cursed in this way, the target retains its alignment, languages, and equipment but otherwise uses the werewolf stat block, excluding actions that require equipment the target doesn't have. During any night when there's a full moon in the sky, the target becomes an NPC under the DM's control and remains so until the night ends. A {@spell Remove Curse} spell or similar magic ends this curse.

**Claw (Wolf or Hybrid Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}21 ({@damage 5d6 + 4}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 16} Strength saving throw or have the {@condition prone} condition.

**Magic Longsword (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}28 ({@damage 4d10 + 6}) slashing damage.
