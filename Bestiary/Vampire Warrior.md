**Multiattack.** The vampire makes two greatsword attacks.

**Multiattack (Vampire Form Only).** The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.

**Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape {@dc 18}).

**Greatsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) slashing damage.

**Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is {@condition grappled} by the vampire, {@condition incapacitated}, or {@condition restrained}. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) piercing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a {@creature vampire spawn} under the vampire's control.

**Charm.** The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be {@condition charmed} by the vampire. The {@condition charmed} target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bite attack. Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.

**Children of the Night (1/Day).** The vampire magically calls {@dice 2d4} swarms of {@creature swarm of bats||bats} or {@creature swarm of rats||rats}, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call {@dice 3d6} {@creature wolf||wolves} instead. The called creatures arrive in {@dice 1d4} rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.
