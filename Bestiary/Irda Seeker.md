**Multiattack.** The seeker uses Augment Physicality, if available, and makes two Crystal Blade attacks.

**Crystal Blade.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d6 + 2}) force damage, plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) force damage if the seeker is Large.

**Augment Physicality (1/Day).** For 1 minute, the seeker magically heightens its physical ability and increases in size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. While augmented, the seeker is Large, and makes Strength and Dexterity saving throws with advantage. If the seeker lacks the room to become Large, it attains the maximum size possible in the space available.

**Change Shape (1/Day).** The seeker magically transforms to look and feel like a Medium Humanoid it has seen. Any equipment the seeker is wearing or carrying isn't transformed, and the seeker's statistics don't change. The seeker reverts to its true form if the seeker is reduced to 0 hit points or if the seeker uses an action to end the transformation.
