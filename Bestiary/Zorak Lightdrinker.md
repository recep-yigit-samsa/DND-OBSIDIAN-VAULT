**Multiattack.** Zorak makes two attacks with his {@item dwarven thrower}, only one of which can be a ranged attack.

**Dwarven Thrower.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 1d8 + 7}) bludgeoning damage, or 12 ({@damage 1d10 + 7}) bludgeoning damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack. On a ranged attack that hits, the hammer deals an extra {@damage 1d8} bludgeoning damage ({@damage 2d8} if the target is a giant). {@hom}If thrown, the weapon flies back to Zorak's hand after the attack.

**Multiattack (Vampire Form Only).** Zorak makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.

**Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, Zorak can grapple the target (escape {@dc 18}).

**Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is {@condition grappled} by Zorak, {@condition incapacitated}, or {@condition restrained}. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) piercing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Zorak regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces his hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a {@creature vampire spawn} under Zorak's control.

**Charm.** Zorak targets one humanoid he can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see Zorak, the target must succeed on a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be {@condition charmed} by Zorak. The {@condition charmed} target regards Zorak as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under Zorak's control, it takes Zorak's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for Zorak's bite attack. Each time Zorak or Zorak's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Zorak is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.

**Children of the Night (1/Day).** Zorak magically calls {@dice 2d4} swarms of {@creature swarm of bats||bats} or {@creature swarm of rats||rats}, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, Zorak can call {@dice 3d6} {@creature wolf||wolves} instead. The called creatures arrive in {@dice 1d4} rounds, acting as allies of Zorak and obeying his spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until Zorak dies, or until Zorak dismisses them as a bonus action.
