**Prime Speaker's Trident.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) piercing damage, and the trident emits a thunderous boom. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from the prongs of the trident must make a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 9 ({@damage 2d8}) thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from Zegana. If the creature is underwater, the damage is increased to 13 ({@dice 3d8}). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

**Deluge {@recharge 4}.** Zegana conjures a wave of water that crashes down on an area within 120 feet of her. The area can be up to 30 feet long, up to 10 feet wide, and up to 10 feet tall. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 18 ({@damage 4d8}) bludgeoning damage and is knocked {@condition prone}. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked {@condition prone}. The water spreads out across the ground, extinguishing unprotected flames it comes in contact with, and then vanishes.
