**Multiattack.** Faldorn makes two Staff of the Woodlands attacks and uses Spellcasting. Or she uses Spellcasting and then Change Shape if available.

**Staff of the Woodlands.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) bludgeoning damage, or 7 ({@damage 1d8 + 3}) bludgeoning damage if wielded with two hands plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) acid damage.

**Shadowlight {@recharge}.** A beam of dim light emerges from Faldorn in a 5-foot-wide, 300-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 ({@damage 6d8}) radiant damage and is {@condition blinded} until Faldorn's next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition blinded}.

**Change Shape (2/Day).** Faldorn magically polymorphs into a Beast or Elemental with a challenge rating of 6 or less, and can remain in this form for up to 9 hours. Faldorn reverts to her true form if she dies or falls {@condition unconscious}. She can revert to her true form using a bonus action on her turn. While in a new form, Faldorn retains her game statistics and ability to speak, but her AC, movement modes, Strength, and Dexterity are replaced by those of the new form, and she gains any special senses, proficiencies, traits, actions, and reactions (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that she lacks. She can cast her spells with verbal or somatic components in her new form. The new form's attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunity to nonmagical attacks.
