**Multiattack.** The guide makes two Slam attacks.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d8 + 2}) bludgeoning damage.

**Smile and Wave.** Each creature of the guide's choice that is within 30 feet of the guide must succeed on a {@dc 11} Wisdom saving throw or be magically {@condition charmed} by the guide for 1 hour. A {@condition charmed} target must move on its turn toward the guide, trying to get within 5 feet of the guide. The target doesn't move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. Whenever the {@condition charmed} target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. A target that successfully saves is immune to any guide's Smile and Wave ability for the next 24 hours.
