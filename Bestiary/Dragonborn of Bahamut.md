**Multiattack.** The dragonborn makes three Longsword attacks.

**Longsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) slashing damage, or 9 ({@damage 1d10 + 4}) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 13 ({@damage 3d8}) radiant damage. The dragonborn can cause the sword to flare with bright light, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition blinded} until the start of the dragonborn's next turn. The sword can flare in this way only once per turn.

**Healing Touch (1/Day).** The dragonborn touches another creature within 5 feet of it. The target magically regains 40 hit points. In addition, all diseases and poisons affecting the target are removed.

**Radiant Breath {@recharge}.** The dragonborn exhales fiery radiance in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 ({@damage 8d10}) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the dragonborn uses this action, it can choose up to three creatures in the cone. These creatures take no damage from the radiance and instead regain 22 ({@dice 4d10}) hit points each.
