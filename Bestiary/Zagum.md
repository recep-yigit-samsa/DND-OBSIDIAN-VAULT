**Multiattack.** Zagum makes three attacks with Disarming Tongue or Oration.

**Disarming Tongue.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 3d4 + 3}) slashing damage. A target hit by this attack has vulnerability to psychic damage until the start of their next turn.

**Oration.** {@atk rs} {@hit 14} to hit, range 60 ft., one target. {@h}35 ({@damage 6d8 + 8}) psychic damage.

**Legal Jargon {@recharge 4}.** Zagum chooses a point he can see within 90 feet of him. All creatures within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a {@dc 22} Wisdom saving throw. Creatures that fail the save are confused for up to 1 minute and must roll a {@dice d10} at the start of each of their turns. On a 1, a creature moves in a random direction then ends their turn. On a 2-6, a creature can't use actions this turn. On a 7-8, a creature must use their action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within their reach that is not a Fiend. On a 9-10, a creature can move and act normally. A confused creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on a success.
