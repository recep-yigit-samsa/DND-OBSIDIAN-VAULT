**Multiattack.** The strigoi makes one Claw attack and makes one Proboscis attack.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d8 + 3}) slashing damage plus 6 ({@damage 1d12}) acid damage.

**Proboscis.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d10 + 3}) piercing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage, and the strigoi regains hit points equal to the amount of necrotic damage dealt. A creature reduced to 0 hit points from this attack dies and leaves nothing behind except its skin and its equipment.

**Ravenous Children (1/Day).** The strigoi magically summons {@dice 1d4 + 2} {@creature stirge||stirges} (see their entry in the Monster Manual) in unoccupied spaces it can see within 30 feet of it. The stirges are under the strigoi's control and act immediately after the strigoi in the initiative order. The stirges disappear after 1 hour, when the strigoi dies, or when the strigoi dismisses them (no action required).
