**Multiattack.** The giant makes three Flying Staff attacks.

**Flying Staff.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 14} to hit, reach 10 ft. or range 30/90 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 3d6 + 8}) bludgeoning damage plus 16 ({@damage 3d10}) thunder damage. {@hom}The staff magically returns to the giant's hand immediately after a ranged attack.

**Thunderous Clap (Requires Cloud Rune).** The giant magically summons a thundercloud that fills a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the giant can see within 60 feet of itself. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 20} Constitution saving throw as the cloud emits a thunderous boom. On a failed save, a creature takes 52 ({@damage 8d12}) thunder damage and has the {@condition prone} condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. The thunderclap is audible within 300 feet of the cloud's center point. The cloud's area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers until the start of the giant's next turn or until a strong wind disperses it.
