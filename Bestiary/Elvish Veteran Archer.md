**Multiattack.** The elvish veteran archer makes three Shortsword attacks or two Longbow attacks.

**Shortsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) piercing damage.

**Longbow.** {@atk rw} {@hit 6} to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) piercing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the archer can pin part of the target's clothing or body to the ground or to a nearby wall or tree. If it does so, the target is {@condition restrained}. A creature, including the target, can take its action to remove the arrow and free the {@condition restrained} target by succeeding on a {@dc 14} Strength check.

**Arrow Spray {@recharge 5}.** The elvish veteran archer fires a flurry of arrows in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a {@dc 14} Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 ({@damage 4d8}) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
