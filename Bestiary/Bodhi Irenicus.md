**Multiattack (Vampire Form Only).** Bodhi makes three Unarmed Strike attacks, one of which can be a Bite attack instead.

**Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}9 ({@damage 1d8 + 5}) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, Bodhi can grapple a Medium-sized or smaller target (escape {@dc 18}).

**Bite (Panther or Vampire Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d6 + 5}) piercing damage plus 14 ({@damage 4d6}) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Bodhi regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A Humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under Bodhi's control.

**Change Shape.** If Bodhi isn't in sunlight, she can polymorph into a Medium panther or back into her true form. While in panther form, Bodhi Irenicus can't speak, her walking speed is 40 feet, and she has a climb speed of 30 feet. Her statistics, other than her size and speed, are unchanged. Anything she is wearing transforms with her, but nothing she is carrying does. She reverts to her true form if she dies.

**Charm.** Bodhi targets one Humanoid she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see Bodhi, the target must succeed on a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition charmed} by Bodhi. The {@condition charmed} target regards Bodhi as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under Bodhi's control, it takes Bodhi's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can. Each time Bodhi or her allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Bodhi is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.
