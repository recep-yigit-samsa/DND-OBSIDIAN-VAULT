**Multiattack.** The malphas makes two Longsword attacks or three Shadow Bolt attacks. If both Longsword attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition blinded} until the end of its next turn, as shadows fill its eyes. A creature that can see through magical darkness has advantage on this saving throw.

**Longsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) slashing damage, or 9 ({@damage 1d10 + 4}) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage.

**Shadow Bolt.** {@atk rs} {@hit 7} to hit, range 60 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 3d6 + 4}) necrotic damage.
