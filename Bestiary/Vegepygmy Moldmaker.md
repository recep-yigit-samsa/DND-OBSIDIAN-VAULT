**Multiattack.** The vegepygmy makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 3d6 + 2}) slashing damage.

**Toxic Mold (2/Day).** The vegepygmy targets a creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. If the target isn't a vegepygmy, it must make a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 13 ({@damage 3d8}) poison damage and has the {@condition blinded} and {@condition deafened} conditions for 1 minute as it becomes covered in a thick layer of mold. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
