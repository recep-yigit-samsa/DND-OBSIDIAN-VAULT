**Multiattack.** The clockwork huntsman makes one Slam attack and two Longsword attacks. It can replace its Slam attack with a Net Cannon attack.

**Longsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d8 + 3}) slashing damage.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) bludgeoning damage.

**Net Cannon (4/Day).** {@atk rw} {@hit 4} to hit, range 10/20 ft., one target. {@h}If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is {@condition restrained}. A mechanism within the clockwork huntsman's chest can fire a net with a 20-foot trailing cable anchored within its chest. A creature, including the {@condition restrained} creature, can take its action to free the {@condition restrained} creature by succeeding on a {@dc 10} Strength check. Alternatively, dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) frees the creature.
