**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d6 + 2}) bludgeoning damage.

**Consuming Inferno.** The living wick's controller can command the living wick to rapidly burn through the remains of its wick, creating a devastating ball of fire. Each creature within 20 feet of the living wick must make a {@dc 12} Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 ({@damage 2d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Flammable objects in the area and that aren't being worn or carried ignite. The living wick then dies, becoming a lifeless puddle of wax.
