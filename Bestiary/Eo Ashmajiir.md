**Twinned Orbs.** {@atk ms,rs} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 90 ft., two targets. {@h}27 ({@damage 5d8 + 5}) acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison or thunder damage (Eo's choice).

**Twinned Spell.** Eo uses Spellcasting to cast {@spell banishment}, dominate person, finger of death, or power word stun. This spell targets a second creature in range.

**Discharge (1/Day).** Eo emits a thin green ray at a creature within 60 feet. The target must make a {@dc 17} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save the target takes 89 ({@damage 14d6 + 40}) force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a {@spell wish} spell.
