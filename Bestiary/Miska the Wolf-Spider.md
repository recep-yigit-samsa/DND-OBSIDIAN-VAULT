**Lupine Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d10 + 6}) piercing damage plus 27 ({@damage 6d8}) poison damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 21} Constitution saving throw or have the {@condition poisoned} condition for 1 minute.

A {@condition poisoned} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
