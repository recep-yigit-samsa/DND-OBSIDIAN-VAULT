**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) piercing damage.

**Fire Burst {@recharge 5}.** The giant strider hurls a gout of flame at a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a {@dc 12} Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 ({@damage 4d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners, and it ignites flammable objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried.
