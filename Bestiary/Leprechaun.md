**Multiattack.** The leprechaun makes two Cobbler's Hammer attacks and can use Spellcasting.

**Cobbler's Hammer.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) bludgeoning damage plus 13 ({@damage 3d8}) force damage. If the target is a creature, its speed is halved until the start of the leprechaun's next turn.

**Gift of Luck (1/Day).** The leprechaun touches a creature and magically gifts the target a measure of luck. The creature gains the leprechaun's Astonishing Luck reaction. The creature can use the reaction three times, after which this gift goes away. The leprechaun can revoke this gift from a creature at any time (no action required). A creature can benefit from only one leprechaun's Gift of Luck at a time.
