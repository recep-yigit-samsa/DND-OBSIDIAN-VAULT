**Multiattack.** The drow makes two scourge attacks.

**Scourge.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d6 + 2}) piercing damage plus 17 ({@damage 5d6}) poison damage.

**Summon Demon (1/Day).** The drow attempts to magically summon a {@creature yochlol} with a {@chance 30|30 percent|30% summoning chance} chance of success. If the attempt fails, the drow takes 5 ({@damage 1d10}) psychic damage. Otherwise, the summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 10 minutes, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.
