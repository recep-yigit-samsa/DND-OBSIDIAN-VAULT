**Multiattack.** The flail snail makes as many flail tentacle attacks as it has flail tentacles, all against the same target.

**Flail Tentacle.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) bludgeoning damage.

**Scintillating Shell (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The snail's shell emits dazzling, colored light until the end of the snail's next turn. During this time, the shell sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, and creatures that can see the snail have disadvantage on attack rolls against it. In addition, any creature within the bright light and able to see the snail when this power is activated must succeed on a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition stunned} until the light ends.

**Shell Defense.** The flail snail withdraws into its shell, gaining a +4 bonus to AC until it emerges. It can emerge from its shell as a bonus action on its turn.
