**Solar Flare {@recharge 5}.** The knight unleashes a blaze of brilliant energy that fills a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the knight.

On a failed save, a creature takes 22 ({@damage 4d10}) radiant damage and has the {@condition blinded} condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. For the next minute, the affected area is filled with bright light that is sunlight.
