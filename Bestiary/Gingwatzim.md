**Energy Drain (True Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}16 ({@damage 4d6 + 2}) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of {@condition exhaustion}. When the target finishes a short or long rest, the target loses every level of {@condition exhaustion} gained from this attack.

**Change Shape.** The gingwatzim changes from its true form—a 3-foot-diameter sphere of luminous ectoplasm—into one of its two alternate forms, or from one of those forms back into its true form. In object form, it can't move or make attacks but otherwise retains its statistics, and it is indistinguishable from the thing it is imitating. In beast form, it retains its hit points but otherwise uses the stat block of the beast it is imitating. When it dies, the gingwatzim reverts to its true form and then vanishes.
