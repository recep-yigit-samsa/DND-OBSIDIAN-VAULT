**Multiattack.** The dragon turtle makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 1d12 + 5}) piercing damage plus 6 ({@damage 1d12}) lightning damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 1d8 + 5}) slashing damage.

**Steam Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon turtle exhales steam in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 16} Constitution saving throw, taking 42 ({@damage 12d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage.
