|---------|--------|----------------|--------------------|

| Miasma {@recharge 4} | 6d12 | 17 | - |


**Multiattack.** Lohezet makes three Withering Blast attacks and uses Miasma if it's available. He can replace one of the attacks with a use of Spellcasting.

**Withering Blast.** {@atk ms,rs} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 2d12 + 5}) necrotic damage.

**Miasma {@recharge 4}.** Lohezet magically conjures a billowing cloud of purple fog in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 120 feet of himself. The area within the sphere is heavily obscured, and when a creature starts its turn in the sphere or enters the sphere for the first time on a turn, it must make a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 39 ({@damage 6d12}) poison damage and is {@condition poisoned} until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition poisoned}. The cloud lasts for 1 minute, until Lohezet ends it early (no action required), or until Lohezet uses this action again. A strong wind disperses the cloud.
