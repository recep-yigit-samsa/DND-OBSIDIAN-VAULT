**Multiattack.** The horakh makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@damage 4d8 + 4}) piercing damage. If the horakh scores a critical hit, it removes one of the target's eyes, provided the target has eyes, and places the eye in a fluid sac on its thorax. While missing half or less of its total number of eyes, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on sight. While missing more than half its total number of eyes, the target is {@condition blinded} until its sight is restored.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 3d8 + 4}) slashing damage.
