**Multiattack.** The rift swine makes one Tusk attack and two Tentacle attacks, or it makes three Warping Bolt attacks.

**Tusk.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) slashing damage.

**Tentacle.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 14}). Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained}.

**Warping Bolt.** {@atk rs} {@hit 4} to hit, range 60 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 3d6 + 1}) force damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls as reality-warping energies temporarily distort its body.
