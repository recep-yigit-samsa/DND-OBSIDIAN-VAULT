**Multiattack.** The mordant snare makes one Bite attack and four Tentacle attacks, or it makes four Acid Spike attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d10 + 6}) piercing damage plus 18 ({@damage 4d8}) acid damage.

**Tentacle.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d8 + 6}) bludgeoning damage, and the target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 18}) if it is a Large or smaller creature. The mordant snare has eleven tentacles, each of which can grapple only one target.

**Acid Spike.** {@atk rw} {@hit 8} to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) piercing damage plus 13 ({@damage 3d8}) acid damage.

**Hidden Trap.** While underground, the mordant snare covers itself in dirt, sand, or other material and lurks just below the surface. The mordant snare is indistinguishable from the ground around it while motionless and covered in this way. When a creature enters the mordant snare's space, the snare can make one Tentacle attack against the creature as a reaction, removing the covering material.
