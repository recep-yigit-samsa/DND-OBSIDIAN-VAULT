**Multiattack.** The golem makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}19 ({@damage 3d8 + 6}) bludgeoning damage.

**Slow {@recharge 5}.** The golem targets one or more creatures it can see within 10 feet of it. Each target must make a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, a target can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Sapphire.** The sapphire has 3 charges. As an action, the golem can expend 1 charge to cast {@spell dispel magic} (as a 9th-level spell) from the sapphire using Constitution as its spellcasting ability. The sapphire ceases to glow if all its charges are expended, but it regains {@dice 1d3} expended charges daily at dawn and glows again once it has 1 or more charges.
