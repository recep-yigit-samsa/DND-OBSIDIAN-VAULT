**Multiattack.** The archaic makes two Force Strike attacks. It can also use Gravity Shift, if available.

**Force Strike.** {@atk ms,rs} {@hit 14} to hit, reach 15 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. {@h}19 ({@damage 2d10 + 8}) force damage, and the target is pulled up to 10 feet toward the archaic or pushed 10 feet away from it, as the archaic chooses.

**Gravity Shift {@recharge 5}.** The archaic reverses gravity for one creature it can see within 100 feet of itself. The creature must succeed on a {@dc 22} Wisdom saving throw or fall 100 feet upward. If the falling creature encounters a solid object (such as a ceiling) in this fall, it strikes the object just as it would during a downward fall. If the creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it hovers there until the start of the archaic's next turn, at which time gravity returns to normal and the creature falls.

**Teleport.** The archaic teleports to an unoccupied space that it can see within 120 feet of itself.
