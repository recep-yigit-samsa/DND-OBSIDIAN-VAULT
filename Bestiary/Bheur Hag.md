**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d8 + 1}) bludgeoning damage plus 3 ({@damage 1d6}) cold damage.

**Maddening Feast.** The hag feasts on the corpse of one enemy within 5 feet of her that died within the past minute. Each creature of the hag's choice that is within 60 feet of her and able to see her must succeed on a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} of her for 1 minute. While {@condition frightened} in this way, a creature is {@condition incapacitated}, can't understand what others say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish; the DM controls the creature's movement, which is erratic. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Maddening Feast for the next 24 hours.
