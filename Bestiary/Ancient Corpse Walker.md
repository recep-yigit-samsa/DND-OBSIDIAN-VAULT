**Multiattack.** The ancient corpse walker makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) bludgeoning damage and 10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the ancient corpse walker regains hit points equal to that amount. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain this way rises 24 hours later as a zombie, but it rises as a corpse walker if it was evil. These undead are loyal to the ancient corpse walker.
