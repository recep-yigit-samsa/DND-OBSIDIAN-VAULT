**Multiattack.** The spawn makes one Bite attack and two Sting attacks. It can replace its Bite attack with a use of Swarming Cough, if available.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d10 + 2}) piercing damage.

**Sting.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d8 + 2}) piercing damage plus 3 ({@damage 1d6}) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or become {@condition poisoned} until the end of its next turn.

**Swarming Cough (3/Day).** The spawn belches forth a swarm of insects. The swarm is an ally of the spawn, obeys its spoken commands, and takes its turn immediately after the spawn's. The swarm remains for 1 minute, until the spawn dies, or until the spawn dismisses it as a bonus action. The spawn can have no more than two swarms under its control at a time.
