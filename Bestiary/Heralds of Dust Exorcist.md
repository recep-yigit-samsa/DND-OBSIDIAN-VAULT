**Multiattack.** The exorcist makes two Grave Burst attacks.

**Grave Burst.** {@atk ms,rs} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. {@h}19 ({@damage 3d10 + 3}) necrotic or radiant damage (exorcist's choice).

**Admit Entity {@recharge 5}.** The exorcist thins the veil of death for a creature it can see within 60 feet of itself, exposing the target to malevolent entities. The target must make a {@dc 14} Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 36 ({@damage 8d8}) psychic damage and has the {@condition incapacitated} condition for 1 minute, during which time it retches and babbles incoherently in a voice that is not its own. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. An {@condition incapacitated} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
