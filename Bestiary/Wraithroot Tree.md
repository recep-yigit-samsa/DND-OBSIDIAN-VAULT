**Multiattack.** The wraithroot tree makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 3d6 + 6}) bludgeoning damage.

**Rock.** {@atk rw} {@hit 11} to hit, range 60/180 ft., one target. {@h}28 ({@damage 4d10 + 6}) bludgeoning damage.

**Wraithstorm {@recharge 5}.** The wraithroot tree pulls life energy from the area around it, leaving creatures temporarily frail. Each creature that is not a construct or undead within 30 feet of the tree must succeed on a {@dc 16} Constitution {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw} or have its speed halved and gain vulnerability to bludgeoning damage until the end of the tree's next turn.
