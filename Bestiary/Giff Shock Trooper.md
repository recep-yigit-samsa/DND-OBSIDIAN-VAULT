**Multiattack.** The giff makes two Greatsword or Musket attacks.

**Greatsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 3d6 + 5}) slashing damage.

**Musket.** {@atk rw} {@hit 5} to hit, range 40/120 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d12 + 2}) piercing damage.

**Thunder Bomb.** The giff lights a grapefruit-sized bomb and throws it at a point up to 60 feet away, where it explodes. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 ({@damage 4d8}) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the giff throws the bomb, roll a {@dice d6}; on a roll of 4 or lower, the giff has no more bombs to throw.
