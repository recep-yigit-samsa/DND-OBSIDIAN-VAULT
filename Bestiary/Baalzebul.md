**Multiattack.** Baalzebul uses Heart of Pestilence (if available), then makes three Slam attacks.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 17} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}19 ({@damage 3d6 + 9}) bludgeoning damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) necrotic damage.

**Pungent Eruption {@recharge 4}.** Baalzebul causes refuse and caustic liquid to spill from the ground at a point he can see within 300 feet. Each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a {@dc 21} Constitution saving throw. Targets take 36 ({@damage 8d8}) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Creatures that fail the save have the {@condition poisoned} condition for 1 minute.

**Heart of Pestilence {@recharge 5}.** Baalzebul channels pestilence into his body, sickening creatures within 50 feet that can see him. Sickened creatures must make a {@dc 21} Charisma saving throw, followed by a {@dc 21} Constitution saving throw. Failing the Charisma save makes a creature have the {@condition frightened} condition, while failing the Constitution save makes a creature weak. While weakened, a creature deals half damage on melee attacks. Both effects last for 1 minute or until a {@spell greater restoration} spell or similar is cast.
