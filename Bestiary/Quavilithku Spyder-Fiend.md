**Multiattack.** The quavilithku makes two Bite attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d10 + 4}) piercing damage plus 17 ({@damage 5d6}) poison damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw or have the {@condition poisoned} condition for 1 minute. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, a creature can't regain hit points. A {@condition poisoned} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Dissolving Web {@recharge 5}.** The quavilithku expels acid-drenched webs in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw, taking 44 ({@damage 8d10}) acid damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Nonmagical objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take 44 ({@damage 8d10}) acid damage.
