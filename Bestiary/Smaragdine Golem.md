**Multiattack.** The smaragdine golem makes two Slam attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Release Spell.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 3d8 + 7}) bludgeoning damage plus 22 ({@damage 5d8}) force damage.

**Release Spell (Recharge Special).** The smaragdine golem releases an absorbed spell's energy in a green burst centered on a point the golem can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature, other than the smaragdine golem, within 5 feet of that point per level of the absorbed spell must make a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 ({@damage 3d6}) force damage per level of the absorbed spell and is {@condition incapacitated} until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't {@condition incapacitated}. The golem can use this action only if it is Charged (see the Magic Vessel trait).
