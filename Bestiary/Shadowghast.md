**Multiattack.** The shadowghast makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d8 + 2}) slashing damage plus 5 ({@damage 1d10}) necrotic damage.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition paralyzed} for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
