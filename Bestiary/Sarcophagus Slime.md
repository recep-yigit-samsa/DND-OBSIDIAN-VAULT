**Multiattack.** The sarcophagus slime can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes two Slam attacks. It can replace one Slam attack with a use of Corrupting Gaze.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 2d6 + 2}) bludgeoning damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) acid damage.

**Corrupting Gaze.** One creature the sarcophagus slime can see within 30 feet of it must make a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw, taking 18 ({@damage 4d8}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target's hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. A Humanoid slain by this effect rises 24 hours later as a sarcophagus slime, unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the sarcophagus slime's choice that is within 60 feet of the sarcophagus slime and aware of it must succeed on a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the sarcophagus slime's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
