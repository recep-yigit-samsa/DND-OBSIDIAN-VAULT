**Multiattack.** Ia'Affrat makes three Bite or Burning Claw attacks, or he makes four Flaming Insect Bolt attacks.

**Bite (Shapeless Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. {@h}21 ({@damage 6d6}) piercing damage plus 14 ({@damage 4d6}) poison damage, or 10 ({@damage 3d6}) piercing damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) poison damage if Ia'Affrat has half of its hp or fewer. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} until the end of its next turn.

**Burning Claw (Humanoid Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}23 ({@damage 4d8 + 5}) slashing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) fire damage.

**Flaming Insect Bolt.** {@atk rs} {@hit 11} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 3d6 + 6}) fire damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) poison damage.

**Inhabit (Shapeless Form Only).** Ia'Affrat crawls into the body of a Humanoid, or a Humanoid corpse that has been dead no more than 7 days, that he can see within 5 feet of him. If the target is unwilling, the target must succeed on a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw or the target loses control of its body, and Ia'Affrat takes control of the body. Ia'Affrat controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. Ia'Affrat can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and he retains his alignment, his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, his Hurl Flame action and Teleport and Consume Host legendary actions, and his condition immunities. He otherwise uses the target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. If the target was a Humanoid corpse, he uses the statistics it had before it died. Ia'Affrat inhabits the target until the target's body is reduced to 0 hp, Ia'Affrat ends it as a bonus action, or Ia'Affrat is forced out by the dispel evil and good or {@spell greater restoration} spell. When the inhabit ends, Ia'Affrat reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target. The target is immune to Ia'Affrat's Inhabit for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the inhabit ends.
