**Multiattack.** The grim jester can use its Killing Joke. It then makes two Necrotic Claw attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

**Necrotic Claw.** {@atk ms} {@hit 9} to hit, range 5 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d8 + 5}) slashing damage plus 14 ({@damage 4d6}) necrotic damage.

**Killing Joke.** The grim jester tells an ancient, nihilistic joke to one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw or fall {@condition prone} in a fit of laughter, becoming {@condition incapacitated} and unable to stand up for 1 minute. A creature that fails this saving throw by 5 or more is reduced to 0 hp instead. The {@condition incapacitated} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 14 ({@damage 4d6}) necrotic damage on a failed save or ending the effect on itself on a success.
