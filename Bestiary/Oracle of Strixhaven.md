**Multiattack.** The Oracle makes two Magic Flare attacks. She can also use Paradoxy, if available.

**Magic Flare.** {@atk ms,rs} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. {@h}24 ({@damage 3d12 + 5}) force damage.

**Paradoxy {@recharge 4}.** Momentary warps in reality appear at three different points the Oracle can see within 120 feet of her. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on each point must make a {@dc 18} Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 33 ({@damage 6d10}) force damage and is pulled up to 15 feet in a straight line toward the center of the sphere. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled. A creature caught in the area of multiple warps is affected by only one, which the Oracle chooses.

**Teleport.** The Oracle teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space she can see within 60 feet of herself.
