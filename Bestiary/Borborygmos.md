**Multiattack.** Borborygmos can use his Frightful Presence. He also makes two attacks: one with his maul and one with his stomp.

**Maul.** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}28 ({@damage 6d6 + 7}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 21} Strength saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}.

**Stomp.** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 2d10 + 7}) bludgeoning damage.

**Rock.** {@atk rw} {@hit 13} to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. {@h}29 ({@damage 4d10 + 7}) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of Borborygmos's choice that is within 60 feet of him and can see or hear him must succeed on a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} of him for 1 minute. The {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Borborygmos's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
