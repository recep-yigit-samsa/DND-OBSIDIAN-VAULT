**Multiattack.** The assassin makes two Shadow Blade attacks.

**Shadow Blade.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) piercing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage. Unless the target is immune to necrotic damage, the target's Strength score is reduced by {@dice 1d4} each time it is hit by this attack. The target dies if its Strength is reduced to 0. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. If a non-evil humanoid dies from this attack, a shadow (see the Monster Manual) rises from the corpse {@dice 1d4} hours later.
