**Multiattack.** The oblivion juggernaut uses unbearable roar and then uses soul drain.

**Soul Drain.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}26 ({@damage 4d10 + 4}) necrotic damage, and the target must make a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target's available Hit Dice are reduced by 2. If this effect reduces the target's Hit Dice to 0, the target falls {@condition unconscious}. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, regaining consciousness on a success. Hit Dice lost this way return at the end of a short rest, in time to spend them to regain hit points. If an oblivion juggernaut kills a living creature with this attack when the creature is at 0 Hit Dice, the target's soul is lost to the realm of shadow. This lost soul can be raised from the dead only with mighty magic, such as wish or divine intervention.

**Unbearable Roar.** Each creature of the oblivion juggernaut's choice that isn't {@condition deafened} and is within 120 feet of the juggernaut must succeed on a {@dc 18} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to any oblivion juggernaut's Unbearable Roar for 24 hours.
