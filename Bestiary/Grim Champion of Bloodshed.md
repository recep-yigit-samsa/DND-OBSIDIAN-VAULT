**Multiattack.** The champion makes four Blazing Morningstar attacks. It can replace one of these attacks with Blade Storm, if available.

**Blazing Morningstar.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 1d8 + 6}) piercing damage plus 14 ({@damage 4d6}) fire damage.

**Blade Storm {@recharge 5}.** The champion conjures a churning storm of spectral blades that fills a 20-foot cube centered on a point it can see within 120 feet of itself. The storm lasts until the start of the champion's next turn. While the storm is active, the area of the storm is difficult terrain. Whenever a creature enters the storm for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a {@dc 19} Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 ({@damage 6d8}) slashing damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.
