**Garrote.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target of the meazel's size or smaller. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) bludgeoning damage, and the target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 13} with disadvantage). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the meazel's turns. The meazel can't make weapon attacks while grappling a creature in this way.

**Shortsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) piercing damage, plus 3 ({@damage 1d6}) necrotic damage.

**Shadow Teleport {@recharge 5}.** The meazel, any equipment it is wearing or carrying, and any creature it is grappling teleport to an unoccupied space within 500 feet of it, provided that the starting space and the destination are in dim light or darkness. The destination must be a place the meazel has seen before, but it need not be within line of sight. If the destination space is occupied, the teleportation leads to the nearest unoccupied space. Any other creature the meazel teleports becomes cursed by shadow for 1 hour. Until this curse ends, every undead and every creature native to the Shadowfell within 300 feet of the cursed creature can sense it, which prevents that creature from hiding from them.
