**Multiattack.** The colossus of Akros makes two melee attacks.

**Spear.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 16} to hit, reach 15 ft., or range 200/600 ft., one target. {@h}23 ({@damage 4d6 + 9}) piercing damage, or 27 ({@damage 4d8 + 9}) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack. If the colossus makes a ranged attack with this spear, the spear magically returns to its hand after the attack.

**Sword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 16} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}36 ({@damage 6d8 + 9}) slashing damage.

**Flames of Akros {@recharge}.** Magical flames issue from the colossus toward up to three creatures the colossus can see within 90 feet of it. Each target must make a {@dc 24} Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 ({@damage 8d8}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, a target also magically catches fire for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns thereafter, the burning target repeats the saving throw. It takes 18 ({@damage 4d8}) fire damage on a failed save, and the effect ends on a successful one.
