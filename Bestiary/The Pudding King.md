**Change Shape.** The Pudding King magically transforms into an {@filter ooze|bestiary|type=ooze}, or back into his true form. He reverts to his true form if he dies. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying is absorbed by the new form. In ooze form, the Pudding King retains his alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. His statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form.

**Create Green Slime (Recharges after a Long Rest).** The Pudding King creates a patch of green slime (see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). The slime appears on a section of wall, ceiling, or floor within 30 feet of the Pudding King.
