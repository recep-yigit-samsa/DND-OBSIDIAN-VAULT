**Ice Dagger.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d4 + 3}) piercing damage plus 5 ({@damage 2d4}) cold damage.

**Icy Shortbow.** {@atk rw} {@hit 5} to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) piercing damage plus 5 ({@damage 2d4}) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of {@condition exhaustion} from the arrow's icy chill. On a success, the target can't suffer further levels of {@condition exhaustion} from any beli's Icy Shortbow for 24 hours. If a creature would suffer a sixth level of {@condition exhaustion} from this attack, it is reduced to 0 hp instead and must make death saving throws as normal. A creature reduced to 0 hp in this way can't suffer further levels of {@condition exhaustion} from any beli's Icy Shortbow for 24 hours.

**Invisibility.** The beli magically turns {@condition invisible} until it attacks or until its {@status concentration} ends (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). Any equipment the beli wears or carries is {@condition invisible} with it.
