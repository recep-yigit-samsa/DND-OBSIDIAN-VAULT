**Multiattack.** The boneless makes two Slam attacks. If both attacks hit a Large or smaller creature, the creature is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 13}), and the boneless can use Crushing Embrace.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d4 + 3}) bludgeoning damage.

**Crushing Embrace.** The boneless wraps its body around a Large or smaller creature {@condition grappled} by it. While the boneless is attached, the target is {@condition blinded} and is unable to breathe. The target must succeed on a {@dc 13} Strength saving throw at the start of each of the boneless' turns or take 5 ({@damage 1d4 + 3}) bludgeoning damage. If something moves the target, the boneless moves with it. The boneless can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can use its action to try to detach the boneless and force it to move into the nearest unoccupied space, doing so with a successful {@dc 13} Strength check. When the boneless dies, it detaches from any creature it is attached to.
