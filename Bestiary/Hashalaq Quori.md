**Multiattack.** The quori uses its Mind Thrust twice.

**Idyllic Touch.** {@atk ms} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 1d10 + 4}) force damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 16} Wisdom saving throw or fall {@condition prone} in a fit of laughter.

**Mind Thrust.** The quori targets a creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a {@dc 16} Wisdom saving throw, taking 18 ({@damage 4d8}) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Possession {@recharge}.** One humanoid that the quori can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a {@dc 16} Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the quori; the quori then disappears, and the target is {@condition incapacitated} and loses control of its body. The quori now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The quori can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being {@condition charmed} and {@condition frightened}. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the quori ends it as a bonus action, or the quori is forced out by an effect like the {@spell dispel evil and good} spell. When the possession ends, the quori reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this quori's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.
