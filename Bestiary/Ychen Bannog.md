**Multiattack.** The ychen bannog makes one Gore attack and two Stomp attacks.

**Gore.** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}25 ({@damage 3d10 + 9}) piercing damage. If the ychen bannog scores a critical hit, it rolls damage dice three times, instead of twice.

**Stomp.** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@damage 3d8 + 9}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 17} Strength saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}.

**Deafening Bellow {@recharge 5}.** The ychen bannog delivers a fearsome bellow in a 60-foot cone that is audible out to 1 mile. Each creature in the area must make a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 44 ({@damage 8d10}) thunder damage and is {@condition deafened} for 1 hour. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't {@condition deafened}. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

**Overrun {@recharge}.** The ychen bannog moves up to 30 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any Large or smaller creature. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. The first time the ychen bannog enters a creature's space during this move, that creature must make a {@dc 17} Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 54 ({@damage 12d8}) bludgeoning damage and is knocked {@condition prone}. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked {@condition prone}.
