**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d10 + 6}) piercing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d6 + 6}) slashing damage.

**Desiccating Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales yellowish necrotic energy in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 20} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 49 ({@damage 14d6}) necrotic damage and is weakened until the end of its next turn. A weakened creature has disadvantage on Strength-based ability checks and Strength saving throws, and the creature's weapon attacks that rely on Strength deal half damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't weakened.
