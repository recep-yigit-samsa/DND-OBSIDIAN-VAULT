**Multiattack.** The matron mother makes two demon staff attacks or three tentacle rod attacks.

**Demon Staff.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) bludgeoning damage, or 8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands, plus 14 ({@damage 4d6}) psychic damage. In addition, the target must succeed on a DC19 Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} of the drow for 1 minute. The {@condition frightened} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Tentacle Rod.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}3 ({@damage 1d6}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is hit three times by the rod on one turn, the target must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or suffer the following effects for 1 minute: the target's speed is halved, it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. Moreover, on each of its turns, it can take either an action or a bonus action, but not both. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Summon Servant (1/Day).** The drow magically summons a {@creature retriever|mtf} or a {@creature yochlol}. The summoned creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 10 minutes, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.
