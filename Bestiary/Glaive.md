**Multiattack.** Glaive makes two Spiked Glaive attacks and two Serrated Bolt attacks.

**Spiked Glaive.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 1d10 + 5}) piercing or slashing damage, or 14 ({@damage 1d10 + 9}) piercing or slashing damage if Glaive is in overdrive.

**Serrated Bolt.** {@atk rw} {@hit 7} to hit, range 60 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 3d6 + 3}) piercing damage. If Glaive has advantage on the attack roll, the serrated bolt lodges in the target, and the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the serrated bolt is removed. A target's speed can be reduced by only one serrated bolt at a time. A creature can use its action to remove a serrated bolt lodged in itself or another creature within its reach; when the bolt is removed from a creature, that creature takes 5 ({@damage 2d4}) slashing damage.
