On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage and is knocked {@condition prone}. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked {@condition prone}.

**Chain Smash {@recharge}.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage, and the target must make a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw.
