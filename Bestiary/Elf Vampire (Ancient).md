**Multiattack.** The vampire makes three attacks, only one of which can be a bite.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d8 + 6}) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, the vampire can grapple the target (escape {@dc 19}).

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d8 + 6}) piercing damage and 17 ({@damage 5d6}) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried rises the following night as a vampire spawn under this vampire's control.

**Fey Majesty.** The vampire targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see or hear the vampire, the target must succeed on a {@dc 17} Charisma saving throw or be {@condition charmed}. The {@condition charmed} target regards the vampire as a friend to be heeded and protected. Although not under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests in the most favorable way and is a willing target for the vampire's bite. While the target is {@condition charmed}, the vampire can communicate with the target telepathically within 300 feet. The vampire can use a bonus action to force the target to repeat the saving throw. If the save fails, the vampire can render the creature full of despair (disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls) or confused (as the {@spell confusion} spell) for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the despair or confusion on itself on a success. Each time the vampire or the vampire's allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire dies, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.

**Mist Form.** The vampire polymorphs into a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form. Anything it wears or carries transforms with it. While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 30 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, but it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. A vampire in mist form is immune to nonmagical damage, except damage from sunlight, and has resistance to damage other than radiant. The vampire reverts to its true form if it dies.
