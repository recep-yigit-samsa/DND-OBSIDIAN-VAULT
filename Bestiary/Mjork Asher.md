**Multiattack.** The mjork asher makes two attacks.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 2d6 + 2}) bludgeoning damage and 7 ({@damage 2d6}) fire damage and Blinding Soot.

**Hurl Soot.** {@atk rs} {@hit 5} to hit, ranged 30/60 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 3d6 + 2}) fire damage and Blinding Soot.

**Create Sootlings (1/Day).** The mjork asher chooses a point within 60 feet of it that it can sense. Smoke fills a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. This smoke lasts until the start of the mjork's next turn or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. Unless dispersed before the start of the mjork's next turn, a sootling swarm forms in a space in the area, favoring a space a creature hostile to the mjork occupies. The swarm takes its turn just after the mjork and obeys the mjork's verbal commands (no action for the mjork). If issued no commands, the swarm acts independently, often attacking a creature that isn't its ally. The swarm can survive indefinitely after being created.
