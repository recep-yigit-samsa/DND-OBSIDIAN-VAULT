**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) slashing damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 13} Dexterity saving throw or the myling attaches to it. While attached, the myling sinks its teeth into the target and can't attack, and at the start of each of the myling's turns, the target takes 17 ({@damage 5d6}) necrotic damage. The attached myling moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the myling's movement. It can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the myling by succeeding on a {@dc 13} Strength check.
