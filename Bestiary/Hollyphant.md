**Tusks.** {@atk mw} {@hit 3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}3 ({@damage 1d6}) piercing damage.

**Trumpet (3/Day).** The hollyphant blows air through its trunk, creating a trumpet sound that can be heard out to a range of 600 feet. The trumpet also creates a 30-foot cone of energy that has one of the following effects, chosen by the hollyphant:

**Trumpet of Blasting.** Each creature in the cone must make a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 17 ({@damage 5d6}) thunder damage and is {@condition deafened} for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition deafened}. Nonmagical objects in the cone that aren't being held or worn take 35 ({@damage 10d6}) thunder damage.

**Trumpet of Sparkles.** Creatures in the cone must make a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw, taking 22 ({@damage 4d8 + 4}) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Evil creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw. Good creatures in the cone take no damage.
