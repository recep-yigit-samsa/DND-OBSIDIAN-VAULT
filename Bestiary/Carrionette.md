**Silver Needle.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}1 piercing damage plus 3 ({@damage 1d6}) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 12} Charisma saving throw or become cursed for 1 minute. While cursed in this way, the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it must roll a {@dice 1d4} and subtract the number rolled from each ability check or attack roll it makes.

**Soul Swap.** The carrionette targets a creature it can see within 15 feet of it that is cursed by its Silver Needle. Unless the target is protected by a {@spell protection from evil and good} spell, it must succeed on a {@dc 12} Charisma saving throw or have its consciousness swapped with the carrionette. The carrionette gains control of the target's body, and the target is {@condition unconscious} for 1 hour, after which it gains control of the carrionette's body. While controlling the target's body, the carrionette retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It otherwise uses the controlled body's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. If the carrionette's body is destroyed, both the carrionette and the target die. A {@spell protection from evil and good} spell cast on the controlled body drives the carrionette out and returns the consciousness of both creatures to their original bodies. The swap is also undone if the controlled body takes damage from the carrionette's Silver Needle.
