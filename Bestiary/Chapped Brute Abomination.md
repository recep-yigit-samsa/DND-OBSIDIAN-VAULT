**Multiattack.** The chapped brute abomination makes two tentacle attacks.

**Tentacle.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@damage 3d10 + 6}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 18}). Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained}, and the brute can't use the tentacle against another target. The chapped brute abomination has four tentacles.

**Engulf.** Each creature {@condition grappled} by the chapped brute abomination must succeed on a {@dc 18} Strength saving throw or be pulled into the brute's body. An engulfed target is {@condition blinded}, {@condition restrained}, unable to breathe, and has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} from effects that originate outside the brute. At the start of each of the brute's turns, each engulfed creature takes 14 ({@damage 4d6}) acid damage. The brute can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make its choice of a {@dc 18} Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. On a success, the creature escapes and uses 10 feet of movement to enter a space of its choice within 5 feet of the brute. If the brute dies, an engulfed creature is no longer {@condition restrained} by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement. If a creature dies inside the brute, the brute doesn't roll for Unstable Life at the start of its next turn and instead regains 20 hit points. The creature's body breaks up inside the brute, and the brute expels anything the creature wore or carried.
