### Actions:

| Ability | Damage | Save DC & Type | On Successful Save |
|---------|--------|----------------|--------------------|
| Load | - | - | - |
| Dead Cannon | 2d6 + 2d6 | 13 | - |

**Load.** The skeleton cannoneer loads the dead cannon.

**Dead Cannon.** The skeleton cannoneer fires its loaded cannon at a point it can see within 500 feet of it, but no closer than 50 feet from it. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must make a {@dc 13} Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 ({@damage 2d6}) bludgeoning damage and 7 ({@damage 2d6}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Alternatively, the cannoneer can choose the cannon as the point of fire. Doing so means the shot goes off inside the cannon, destroying it and increasing each type of damage by 3 ({@dice 1d6}).

**Pistol Club.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d6 + 2}) bludgeoning damage and 3 ({@damage 1d6}) necrotic damage.

**Dead Pistol.** {@atk rw} {@hit 5} to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d10 + 3}) piercing damage plus 3 ({@damage 1d6}) necrotic damage.
