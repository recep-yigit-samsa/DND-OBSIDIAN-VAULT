**Multiattack.** The hierophant makes two Herald's Axe attacks or three Comet Blast attacks.

**Herald's Axe.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 1d12 + 5}) slashing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage.

**Comet Blast.** {@atk rs} {@hit 9} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d10 + 5}) force damage.

**All-Consuming Star {@recharge}.** The hierophant conjures a manifestation of the All-Consuming Star: brilliant light and haunting screams that fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the hierophant can see within 60 feet of itself. Each creature within the sphere has the {@condition blinded} and {@condition deafened} conditions. Each creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 ({@damage 6d8}) psychic damage and has the {@condition incapacitated} condition until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. The manifestation persists until the hierophant dies, has the {@condition incapacitated} condition, uses a bonus action to end the effect, or uses this action again.
