**Bites.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. {@h}28 ({@damage 8d6}) piercing damage, or 14 ({@damage 4d6}) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer, and the swarm can attempt to end one random magical effect of 2nd level or lower on the target. This effect works like the {@spell dispel magic} spell, except the swarm must always make an ability check. Its ability check for this is +5.
