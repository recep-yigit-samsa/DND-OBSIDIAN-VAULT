**Multiattack.** The narzugon uses its Infernal Command or Terrifying Command. It also makes three hellfire lance attacks.

**Hellfire Lance.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 1d12 + 5}) piercing damage plus 16 ({@damage 3d10}) fire damage. If this damage kills a creature, the creature's soul rises from the River Styx as a lemure in Avernus in {@dice 1d4} hours. If the creature isn't revived before then, only a {@spell wish} spell or killing the lemure and casting true resurrection on the creature's original body can restore it to life. Constructs and devils are immune to this effect.

**Infernal Command.** Each ally of the narzugon within 60 feet of it can't be {@condition charmed} or {@condition frightened} until the end of the narzugon's next turn.

**Terrifying Command.** Each creature that isn't a fiend within 60 feet of the narzugon that can hear it must succeed on a {@dc 17} Charisma saving throw or become {@condition frightened} of it for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that makes a successful saving throw is immune to this narzugon's Terrifying Command for 24 hours.

**Healing (1/Day).** The narzugon, or one creature it touches, regains up to 100 hit points.
