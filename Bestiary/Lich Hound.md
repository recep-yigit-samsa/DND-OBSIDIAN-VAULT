**Multiattack.** The lich hound can use its Eerie Howl. It then makes two Bite attacks. If both attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw or take 7 ({@damage 2d6}) slashing damage and be {@condition incapacitated} until the end of its next turn.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 14} Strength saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}.

**Eerie Howl.** The lich hound releases an eerie howl that fades in and out and echoes strangely. Each creature within 30 feet of the lich hound must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the lich hound's Eerie Howl for the next 24 hours.
