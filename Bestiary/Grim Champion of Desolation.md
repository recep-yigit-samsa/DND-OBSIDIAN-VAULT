**Multiattack.** The champion makes two Leeching Blade attacks and uses Hollow Void.

**Leeching Blade.** {@atk mw} {@hit 14} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d6 + 6}) slashing damage plus 33 ({@damage 6d10}) cold damage, and the champion regains 10 hit points.

**Hollow Void.** The champion summons a hungering rift around a creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The creature must make a {@dc 22} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 49 ({@damage 11d8}) force damage and has the {@condition stunned} condition until the start of the champion's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only. If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this effect, the creature dies, and its body crumbles to dust.
