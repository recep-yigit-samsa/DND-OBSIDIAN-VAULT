**Multiattack.** The kelubar makes two Bite attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 1d10 + 6}) piercing damage plus 18 ({@damage 4d8}) acid damage.

**Spit Acid.** The kelubar spits acid in a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 17} Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 ({@damage 6d8}) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Summon Demodand (1/Day).** The kelubar has a 40 percent chance of summoning its choice of {@dice 1d2} farastu demodands or 1 kelubar demodand. A summoned demodand appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the kelubar, acts as an ally of the kelubar, and can't summon other demodands. It remains for 1 minute, until it or the kelubar dies, or until the kelubar dismisses it as an action.
