**Multiattack.** The barrowghast makes two Slam attacks. It can replace one Slam attack with a Life Drain attack.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 2d12 + 5}) bludgeoning damage.

**Life Drain.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. {@h}9 ({@damage 1d8 + 5}) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 16} Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A Humanoid slain by this attack immediately rises as a zombie (see the Monster Manual). The zombie acts as an ally of the barrowghast but isn't under its control.
