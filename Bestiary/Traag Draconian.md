**Multiattack.** The draconian makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d8 + 5}) slashing damage.

**Flaming Carnage {@recharge 5}.** The draconian indulges its rage, wreathing itself in fire and moving up to its speed. The draconian can enter creatures' spaces during this move. During this movement, when the draconian enters a creature's space, the creature must make a {@dc 14} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 ({@damage 4d10}) fire damage and is knocked {@condition prone}. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is pushed to the nearest space out of the draconian's path. A creature can be affected by this draconian's Flaming Carnage only once during a turn.
