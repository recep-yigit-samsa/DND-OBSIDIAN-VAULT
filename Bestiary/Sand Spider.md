**Multiattack.** The sand spider makes one Bite attack and two Impaling Leg attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}10 ({@damage 1d10 + 5}) piercing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) poison damage.

**Impaling Leg.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 16} Strength saving throw or be {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 16}). Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained} and takes 7 ({@damage 2d6}) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns, and the sand spider can't use the same Impaling Leg on another target. The sand spider has four Impaling Legs.
