**Multiattack.** The dandylion makes one Bite attack and one Claws attack.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d6 + 6}) piercing damage.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 4d6 + 6}) slashing damage. If the dandylion moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target must succeed on a {@dc 17} Strength saving throw or have the {@condition prone} condition. If the target has the {@condition prone} condition, the dandylion can make one Bite attack against it as a bonus action.

**Rejuvenating Seedpods (2/Day).** The dandylion releases a burst of seedpods from its tail, filling a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature of the dandylion's choice in the sphere can immediately end one of the following conditions on itself (creature's choice): {@condition blinded}, {@condition deafened}, {@condition paralyzed}, or {@condition poisoned}. In addition, all soil in the sphere's area is enriched, restoring withered vegetation in the area to full health and causing all crops in the area to produce twice the normal harvest for the next year.
