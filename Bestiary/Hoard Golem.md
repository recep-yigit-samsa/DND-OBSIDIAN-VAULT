**Multiattack.** The hoard golem makes two Slam attacks.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@damage 3d10 + 6}) bludgeoning damage plus 18 ({@damage 4d8}) force damage.

**Thieving Whirlwind {@recharge 5}.** The hoard golem partially disperses into a whirlwind of coins, gemstones, and other valuables then recoalesces. Each creature within 20 feet of the golem must make a {@dc 17} Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 44 ({@damage 8d10}) bludgeoning damage and loses one object it is wearing or carrying. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn't lose an object. Each object the golem steals must weigh no more than 20 pounds and not be wrapped around or firmly attached to a creature. For example, the golem could steal a belt pouch full of coins or a creature's jewel-encrusted dagger, but it can't steal a creature's shirt or armor. The hoard golem steals objects of high value over those of minimal value. The stolen object becomes part of the golem's body and can't be retrieved until the golem dies.
