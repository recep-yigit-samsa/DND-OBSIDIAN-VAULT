**Multiattack.** The sunbird makes two talon attacks.

**Talon.** {@atk mw} {@hit 14} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d6 + 9}) slashing damage plus 14 ({@damage 4d6}) fire damage, and the target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 18}). Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained}, and the sunbird can't attack another target with that talon. A {@condition grappled} creature takes 11 ({@damage 2d10}) fire damage at the start of each of the sunbird's turns.
