**Multiattack.** Minazorond can use his Frightful Presence. He then makes three attacks: one with his bite and two with his claws.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 16} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 2d10 + 9}) piercing damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 16} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d6 + 9}) slashing damage.

**Tail.** {@atk mw} {@hit 16} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 2d8 + 9}) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of Minazorond's choice that is within 120 feet of Minazorond and aware of him must succeed on a {@dc 20} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Minazorond's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Breath Weapons {@recharge 5}.** Minazorond uses one of the following breath weapons.

**Lightning Breath.** Minazorond exhales lightning in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a {@dc 23} Dexterity saving throw, taking 88 ({@damage 16d10}) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Repulsion Breath.** Minazorond exhales repulsion energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a {@dc 23} Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 60 feet away from Minazorond.

**Change Shape.** Minazorond magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than his own, or back into his true form. He reverts to his true form if he dies. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (Minazorond's choice). In a new form, Minazorond retains his alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. His statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.
