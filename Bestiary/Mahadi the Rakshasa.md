**Multiattack.** Mahadi makes four claw attacks.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 2d6 + 2}) slashing damage, and the target is cursed if it's a creature. The curse takes effect whenever the target takes a short or long rest, filling the target's thoughts with horrible images and dreams. The cursed target gains no benefit from finishing a short or long rest. The curse lasts until it is lifted by a {@spell remove curse} spell or similar magic.

**Summon Erinyes (1/Day).** Mahadi summons Ilzabet, an erinyes bound to him by an infernal contract. The erinyes appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of him, acts as his ally, and can't summon other devils. The erinyes remains for 10 minutes or until Mahadi dismisses it as an action. If the erinyes dies, Mahadi loses this action option.
