**Constrict.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 20 ft., one creature. {@h}The target takes 11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) bludgeoning damage, and it is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 14}). Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained}, and it takes 21 ({@damage 6d6}) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The vine can constrict only one target at a time.

**Entangling Vines.** The assassin vine can animate normal vines and roots on the ground in a 15-foot square within 30 feet of it. These plants turn the ground in that area into {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. A creature in that area when the effect begins must succeed on a {@dc 13} Strength saving throw or be {@condition restrained} by entangling vines and roots. A creature {@condition restrained} by the plants can use its action to make a {@dc 13} Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check, freeing itself on a successful check. The effect ends after 1 minute or when the assassin vine dies or uses Entangling Vines again.
