**Multiattack.** The ssurran makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}4 ({@damage 1d6 + 1}) slashing damage.

**Javelin.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 3} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. {@h}4 ({@damage 1d6 + 1}) piercing damage plus 4 ({@damage 1d8}) poison damage.

**Poison Bomb.** The ssurran throws a tangerine-sized bomb at a point up to 60 feet away, where it explodes, releasing a 10-foot-radius sphere of poisonous gas that disperses quickly. Each creature in the sphere must make a {@dc 11} Constitution saving throw, taking 10 ({@damage 3d6}) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the ssurran throws a bomb, roll a {@dice d6}; on a roll of 4 or lower, the ssurran has no more bombs to throw.
