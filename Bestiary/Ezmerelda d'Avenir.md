**Multiattack.** Ezmerelda makes three attacks: two with her +1 rapier and one with her +1 handaxe or her silvered shortsword.

**Rapier +1.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 1d8 + 5}) piercing damage.

**Handaxe +1.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) slashing damage.

**Silvered Shortsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) piercing damage.

**Curse (Recharges after a Long Rest).** Ezmerelda targets one creature that she can see within 30 feet of her. The target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or be cursed. While cursed, the target has vulnerability to one type of damage of Ezmerelda's choice. The curse lasts until ended with a {@spell greater restoration} spell, a {@spell remove curse} spell, or similar magic. When the curse ends, Ezmerelda takes {@damage 3d6} psychic damage.

**Evil Eye (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** Ezmerelda targets one creature that she can see within 10 feet of her and casts one of the following spells on the target (save {@dc 14}), requiring neither somatic nor material components to do so: animal friendship, charm person, or hold person. If the target succeeds on the initial saving throw, Ezmerelda is {@condition blinded} until the end of her next turn. Once a target succeeds on a saving throw against this effect, it is immune to the Evil Eye power of all Vistani for 24 hours.
