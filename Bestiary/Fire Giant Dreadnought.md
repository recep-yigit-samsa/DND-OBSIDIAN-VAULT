**Multiattack.** The giant makes two fireshield attacks.

**Fireshield.** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@damage 4d6 + 8}) bludgeoning damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) fire damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) piercing damage.

**Rock.** {@atk rw} {@hit 13} to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. {@h}30 ({@damage 4d10 + 8}) bludgeoning damage.

**Shield Charge.** The giant moves up to 30 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any creature smaller than Huge. The first time it enters a creature's space during this move, it makes a fireshield attack against that creature. If the attack hits, the target must also succeed on a {@dc 21} Strength saving throw or be pushed ahead of the giant for the rest of this move. If a creature fails the save by 5 or more, it is also knocked {@condition prone} and takes 18 ({@damage 3d6 + 8}) bludgeoning damage, or 29 ({@damage 6d6 + 8}) bludgeoning damage if it was already {@condition prone}.
