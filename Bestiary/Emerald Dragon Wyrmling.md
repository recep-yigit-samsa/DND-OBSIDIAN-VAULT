**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d10 + 2}) piercing damage plus 3 ({@damage 1d6}) psychic damage.

**Disorienting Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a wave of psychic dissonance in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 12} Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 17 ({@damage 5d6}) psychic damage, and until the end of its next turn, when the creature makes an attack roll or an ability check, it must roll a {@dice d4} and reduce the total by the number rolled. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage with no additional effects.
