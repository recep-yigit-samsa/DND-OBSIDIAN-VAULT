**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 1d10 + 4}) piercing damage plus 3 ({@damage 1d6}) poison damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) slashing damage.

**Nightmare Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a cloud of spores in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 ({@damage 4d10}) psychic damage, and it is {@condition frightened} of the dragon for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage with no additional effects. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
