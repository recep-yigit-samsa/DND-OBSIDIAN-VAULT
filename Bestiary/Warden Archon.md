**Multiattack.** The archon makes two Claw attacks and one Tracker's Bite attack.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, the target has the {@condition grappled} condition (escape {@dc 18}). The archon can have only one creature {@condition grappled} in this way at a time.

**Tracker's Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 3d6 + 5}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, for the next 24 hours, the archon knows the distance and direction to the target while they are both on the same plane of existence.

**Teleport.** The archon teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see within 120 feet of itself.
