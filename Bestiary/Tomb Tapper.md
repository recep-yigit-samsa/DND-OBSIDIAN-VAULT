**Multiattack.** The tomb tapper makes two melee attacks with its sledgehammer or with its claws. If it hits the same creature with both claws, it can pull that creature within 5 feet of its mouth and make a bite attack against it.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@damage 3d10 + 6}) slashing damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 3d6 + 6}) slashing damage.

**Sledgehammer.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 15 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. {@h}27 ({@damage 6d6 + 6}) bludgeoning or force damage (tomb tapper's choice). If thrown, the hammer returns to the tomb tapper at the end of its turn, landing at the tomb tapper's feet if it doesn't have a hand free to catch the weapon.
