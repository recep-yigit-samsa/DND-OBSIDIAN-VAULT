**Multiattack.** The corrupted ogre can use its Chieftain's Command or Chieftain's Might. It then makes two Greatclub or Javelin attacks.

**Greatclub.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d8 + 6}) bludgeoning damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) force damage.

**Javelin.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d6 + 6}) piercing damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) force damage.

**Chieftain's Command.** The corrupted chieftain barks an order to one Giant it can see within 30 feet of it, sharing a measure of its power with the target. The target has advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of the chieftain's next turn. In addition, the next attack roll against the target before the start of the chieftain's next turn has disadvantage.

**Chieftain's Might.** The corrupted chieftain causes its eyes to glow, its muscles to swell, and the ground beneath its feet to rumble. Each creature within 15 feet of the chieftain must succeed on a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} until the end of its next turn.
