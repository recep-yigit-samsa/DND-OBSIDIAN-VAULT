**Multiattack.** The beast makes two Claw attacks and one Tusk attack.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 1d12 + 8}) slashing damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 21} Strength saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}.

**Tusk.** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d8 + 8}) slashing damage.

**Disintegration Gaze {@recharge 5}.** The beast targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must make a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw, taking 70 ({@damage 10d6 + 40}) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this magical effect reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is disintegrated and leaves nothing behind, except a pile of ashes plus whatever equipment it was wearing or carrying.
