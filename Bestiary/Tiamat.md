**Multiattack.** Tiamat can use her Frightful Presence. She then makes three attacks: two with her claws and one with her tail.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 19} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}24 ({@damage 4d6 + 10}) slashing damage.

**Tail.** {@atk mw} {@hit 19} to hit, reach 25 ft., one target. {@h}28 ({@damage 4d8 + 10}) piercing damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of Tiamat's choice that is within 240 feet of Tiamat and aware of her must succeed on a {@dc 26} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Tiamat's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
