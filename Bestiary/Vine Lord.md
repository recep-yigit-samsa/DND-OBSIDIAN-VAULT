**Thorned Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d8 + 5}) bludgeoning damage plus 10 ({@damage 4d4}) piercing damage.

**Forest Protectors (1/Day).** The vine lord magically calls {@dice 1d4} awakened trees or tendril puppets, or it calls 1 Plant with a challenge rating of 4 or lower.

The Plants remain for 1 hour, until the vine lord dies, or until the vine lord dismisses them as a bonus action.
