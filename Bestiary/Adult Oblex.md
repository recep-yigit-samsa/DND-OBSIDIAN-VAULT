### Actions:

| Ability | Damage | Save DC & Type | On Successful Save |

| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Pseudopod | 1d6 + 4 + 2d4 | - | - |
| Eat Memories | 4d8 | 15 | - |


**Multiattack.** The oblex makes one pseudopod attack and uses Eat Memories.

**Pseudopod.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) bludgeoning damage plus 5 ({@damage 2d4}) psychic damage.

**Eat Memories.** The oblex targets one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw or take 18 ({@damage 4d8}) psychic damage and become memory drained until it finishes a short or long rest or until it benefits from the {@spell greater restoration} or {@spell heal} spell. Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead succeed on the save automatically. While memory drained, the target must roll a {@dice d4} and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the {@dice d4} becomes a {@dice d6}, the {@dice d6} becomes a {@dice d8}, and so on until the die becomes a {@dice d20}, at which point the target becomes {@condition unconscious} for 1 hour. The effect then ends. When an oblex causes a target to become memory drained, the oblex learns all the languages the target knows and gains all its proficiencies, except for any saving throw proficiencies.
