**Longsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d8 + 3}) slashing damage, or 14 ({@damage 2d10 + 3}) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Dagger.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d4 + 3}) piercing damage, or 8 ({@damage 2d4 + 3}) piercing damage if used to make a melee attack.

**Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, the bandit lord can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a {@dice d4} to its roll provided it can hear and understand the bandit lord. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the bandit lord is {@condition incapacitated}.
