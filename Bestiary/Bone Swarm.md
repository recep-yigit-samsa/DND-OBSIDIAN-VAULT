**Multiattack.** The bone swarm makes two Swirling Bones attacks. It can replace one Swirling Bones attack with one Death's Embrace attack, if available.

**Swirling Bones.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. {@h}36 ({@damage 8d8}) bludgeoning, 36 ({@damage 8d8}) piercing, or 36 ({@damage 8d8}) slashing damage (the bone swarm's choice), or 18 ({@damage 4d8}) bludgeoning, 8 ({@damage 4d8}) piercing, or 8 ({@damage 4d8}) slashing damage (the bone swarm's choice) if the swarm has half of its hp or fewer.

**Death's Embrace {@recharge 5}.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. {@h}The target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 16}) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the creature is {@condition restrained} and any attack against the bone swarm has a 50 percent chance of hitting the {@condition grappled} creature instead. The bone swarm can have only one creature {@condition grappled} at a time. The {@condition grappled} creature has advantage on ability checks made to escape the grapple when the bone swarm has half of its hp or fewer.
