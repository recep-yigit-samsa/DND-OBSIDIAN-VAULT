**Multiattack.** The talon beast makes two Talon attacks or a Talon attack and a Beak attack.

**Beak.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d10 + 6}) piercing damage, and if the target has any spell effects on itself or any magic items in its possession, the target must make a {@dc 15} Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a random spell effect on the target ends. If the target has no spell effects on it, one random magic item in its possession has its magical properties suppressed for 1 minute. If the item is a potion or scroll, it becomes nonmagical instead.

**Talon.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d8 + 6}) slashing damage, and the target has the {@condition grappled} condition (escape {@dc 17}). Until the grapple ends, the target has the {@condition restrained} condition, and the talon beast can't use Talon on another target.
