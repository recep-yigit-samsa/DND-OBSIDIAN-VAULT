**Multiattack.** The shadow fey enchantress makes two Rapier attacks. She can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

**Rapier.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d8 + 2}) piercing damage plus 14 ({@damage 4d6}) psychic damage.

**Shadow Bolt.** {@atk rs} {@hit 7} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) cold damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage.

**Beguiling Whispers {@recharge 5}.** The enchantress speaks sweet words to a creature she can see within 60 feet of her and that can hear her. The creature must succeed on a {@dc 15} Charisma saving throw or be {@condition charmed} for 1 minute. While {@condition charmed} in this way, the creature has disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws against spells cast by the enchantress.

**Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, the enchantress can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that she can see within 30 feet of her makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a {@dice d4} to its roll, provided it can hear and understand the enchantress. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the enchantress is {@condition incapacitated}.
