**Multiattack.** Vecna uses Flight of the Damned (if available), Rotten Fate, or Spellcasting. He then makes two attacks with Afterthought.

**Afterthought.** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d4 + 5}) piercing damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it is afflicted by entropic magic, taking 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. Immediately after taking this damage on its turn, the target must make a {@dc 20} Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Until it succeeds on this save, the afflicted target can't regain hit points.

**Flight of the Damned {@recharge 5}.** Vecna conjures a torrent of flying, spectral entities that fill a 120-foot cone and pass through all creatures in that area before dissipating. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 22} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 36 ({@damage 8d8}) necrotic damage and has the {@condition frightened} condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Rotten Fate.** Vecna causes necrotic magic to engulf one creature he can see within 120 feet of himself. The target must make a {@dc 22} Constitution saving throw, taking 96 ({@damage 8d8 + 60}) necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Humanoid killed by this magic rises as a zombie at the start of Vecna's next turn and acts immediately after Vecna in the initiative order. The zombie is under Vecna's control.
