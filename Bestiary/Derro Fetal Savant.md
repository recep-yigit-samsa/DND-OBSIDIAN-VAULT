**Multiattack.** The fetal savant makes two Psychic Burst attacks.

**Psychic Burst.** {@atk ms,rs} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d8 + 5}) psychic damage.

**Soul Exchange {@recharge}.** The savant exchanges its soul with one Humanoid it can see within 20 feet of it. Its body becomes {@condition paralyzed}, the target's soul inhabits the savant's {@condition paralyzed} body, and the savant inhabits the target's body, taking full control of it. The savant retains its alignment, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, its Psychic Burst action, and its immunity to being {@condition charmed} and {@condition frightened}. It otherwise uses the target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The exchange lasts until the target's body or the savant's body is reduced to 0 hp, the savant ends it as a bonus action, or the savant is forced out by an effect like the {@spell dispel evil and good} spell. When the exchange ends, the target returns to its body, regaining control, and the savant's soul returns to its body, which is no longer {@condition paralyzed}. The target is immune to this savant's Soul Exchange for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the exchange ends.
