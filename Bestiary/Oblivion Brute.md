**Soul Drain.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}16 ({@damage 3d8 + 3}) necrotic damage, and the target must make a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target's available Hit Dice are reduced by 1. If this effect reduces the target's Hit Dice to 0, the target falls {@condition unconscious}. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, regaining consciousness on a success. Hit Dice lost this way return at the end of a short rest, in time to spend them to regain hit points. If an oblivion brute kills a living creature with this attack when the creature is at 0 Hit Dice, the target's soul is lost to the realm of shadow. This lost soul can be raised from the dead only with mighty magic, such as wish or divine intervention.

**Unbearable Howl (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The oblivion brute emits a howl in a 30-foot cone. Each creature that isn't {@condition deafened} or undead in the area must succeed on a {@dc 13} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. While {@condition frightened} this way, a creature's speed is halved. A {@condition frightened} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to any oblivion brute's Unbearable Howl for the next 24 hours.
