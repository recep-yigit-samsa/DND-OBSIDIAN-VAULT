**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the elder dinosaur's choice within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the elder dinosaur is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself ona success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the elder dinosaur's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Swallow.** The elder dinosaur makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is {@condition blinded} and {@condition restrained}, it has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects outside the elder dinosaur, and it takes 56 ({@damage 16d6}) acid damage at the start of each of the elder dinosaur's turns. If the elder dinosaur takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, it must succeed on a {@dc 20} Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall {@condition prone} in a space within 10 feet of it. If the elder dinosaur dies, a swallowed creature is no longer {@condition restrained} by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting {@condition prone}.
