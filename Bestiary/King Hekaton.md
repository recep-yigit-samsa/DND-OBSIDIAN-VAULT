**Multiattack.** Hekaton makes two broken chain attacks.

**Broken Chain.** {@atk mw} {@hit 14} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 3d6 + 9}) bludgeoning damage.

**Ballista.** {@atk rw} {@hit 6} to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 3d10 + 2}) piercing damage.

**Lightning Strike {@recharge 5}.** Hekaton hurls a magical lightning bolt at a point he can see within 500 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a {@dc 17} Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 ({@damage 12d8}) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Thunderous Stomp {@recharge}.** Hekaton stomps the ground, triggering a thunderclap. All other creatures within 15 feet of him must succeed on a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw or take 33 ({@damage 6d10}) thunder damage and be {@condition deafened} until the start of Hekaton's next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition deafened}. The thunderclap can be heard out to a range of 1,200 feet.
