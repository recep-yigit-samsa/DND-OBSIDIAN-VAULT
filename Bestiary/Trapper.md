**Smother.** One Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of the trapper must succeed on a {@dc 14} Dexterity saving throw or be {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 14}). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 17 ({@damage 4d6 + 3}) bludgeoning damage plus 3 ({@damage 1d6}) acid damage at the start of each of its turns. While {@condition grappled} in this way, the target is {@condition restrained}, {@condition blinded}, and at risk of suffocating. The trapper can smother only one creature at a time.
