**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 2d6 + 2}) piercing damage, and the broodiken attaches to the target. While attached, the broodiken can't attack, and at the start of each of the broodiken's turns, the target takes 9 ({@damage 2d6 + 2}) piercing damage. The attached broodiken moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the broodiken's movement. It can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the broodiken by succeeding on a {@dc 9} Strength check.
