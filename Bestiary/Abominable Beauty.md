**Multiattack.** The abominable beauty uses Blinding Gaze. She then makes two Slam attacks.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage plus 21 ({@damage 6d6}) fire damage.

**Blinding Gaze.** The abominable beauty fixes her gaze on a creature within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the beauty's eyes, the target must succeed on a {@dc 16} Charisma saving throw or be {@condition blinded} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the abominable beauty's Blinding Gaze for the next 24 hours.

**Deafening Voice {@recharge 5}.** The abominable beauty speaks a lilting incantation. Each creature within 30 feet of her and that can hear her voice must make a {@dc 16} Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 31 ({@damage 9d6}) thunder damage and is {@condition deafened} for 1 hour. On a success, a creature takes half the damage, isn't {@condition deafened}, and is immune to the abominable beauty's Deafening Voice for the next 24 hours.
