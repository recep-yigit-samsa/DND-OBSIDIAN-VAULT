**Multiattack (Humanoid or Hybrid Form).** In Humanoid form, Pelyious makes two Scimitar attacks or two Hand Crossbow attacks. In hybrid form, he can substitute one Scimitar attack for a Bite attack.

**Scimitar (Humanoid or Hybrid Form).** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) slashing damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) poison damage.

**Hand Crossbow (Humanoid or Hybrid Form).** {@atk rw} {@hit 6} to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) piercing damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) poison damage.

**Bite (Hybrid Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 1d10 + 4}) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 16}) and until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained}, and Pelyious can't Bite another target.

**Change Shape.** Pelyious polymorphs into a crocodile-humanoid hybrid, or back into his true form, which is Humanoid. His statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. He reverts to his true form if he dies.
