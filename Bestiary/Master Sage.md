**Shocking Grasp (Cantrip).** {@atk ms} {@hit 8} to hit (with advantage if the target is wearing armor made of metal), reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}13 ({@damage 3d8}) lightning damage, and the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

**Fireball (3rd-Level Spell; 3/Day).** The sage creates a fiery explosion centered on a point it can see within 150 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a {@dc 14} Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 ({@damage 8d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners and ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
