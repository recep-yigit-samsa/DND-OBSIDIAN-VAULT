**Multiattack.** The yagnoloth makes one massive arm attack and one electrified touch attack, or it makes one massive arm attack and teleports before or after the attack.

**Electrified Touch.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}27 ({@damage 6d8}) lightning damage.

**Massive Arm.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}23 ({@damage 3d12 + 4}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 16} Constitution saving throw or is {@condition stunned} until the end of the yagnoloth's next turn.

**Life Leech.** The yagnoloth touches one {@condition incapacitated} creature within 15 feet of it. The target takes 36 ({@damage 7d8 + 4}) necrotic damage, and the yagnoloth gains temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt. The target must succeed on a {@dc 16} Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest, and the target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

**Battlefield Cunning {@recharge 4}.** Up to two allied yugoloths within 60 feet of the yagnoloth that can hear it can use their reactions to make one melee attack each.

**Teleport.** The yagnoloth magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
