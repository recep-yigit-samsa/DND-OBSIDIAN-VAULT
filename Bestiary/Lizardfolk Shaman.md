**Multiattack (Lizardfolk Form Only).** The lizardfolk makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d6 + 2}) piercing damage, or 7 ({@damage 1d10 + 2}) piercing damage in {@creature crocodile} form. If the lizardfolk is in crocodile form and the target is a Large or smaller creature, the target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 12}). Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained}, and the lizardfolk can't bite another target. If the lizardfolk reverts to its true form, the grapple ends.

**Claws (Lizardfolk Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}4 ({@damage 1d4 + 2}) slashing damage.

**Change Shape (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The lizardfolk magically polymorphs into a {@creature crocodile}, remaining in that form for up to 1 hour. It can revert to its true form as a bonus action. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
