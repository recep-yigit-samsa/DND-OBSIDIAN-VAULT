**Multiattack.** The fisher makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 4d6 + 6}) slashing damage.

**Retract Filament.** One Huge or smaller creature {@condition grappled} by the fisher's Adhesive Filament must make a {@dc 20} Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pulled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the fisher, and the fisher makes one Claw attack against it with advantage. Anyone else who was attached to the filament is released. Until the grapple ends on the target, the fisher can't use Adhesive Filament.
