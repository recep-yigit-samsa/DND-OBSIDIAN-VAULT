**Multiattack.** The doom croaker makes one Peck attack and one Runestaff attack, or it makes two Rune Blast attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Ghost Wings or Prophetic Call, if available.

**Peck.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 2d4 + 2}) piercing damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) radiant damage.

**Runestaff.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d8 + 2}) bludgeoning damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) radiant damage.

**Rune Blast.** {@atk rs} {@hit 7} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 3d8 + 4}) radiant damage.

**Ghost Wings.** The doom croaker furiously "beats" a set of phantasmal wings. Each creature within 5 feet of the ravenfolk must succeed on a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw or be {@condition blinded} until the start of its next turn.

**Prophetic Magic.** The ravenfolk doom croaker can cast the {@spell augury} spell and {@spell thaumaturgy} cantrip at will, requiring no material components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability.

**Prophetic Caw {@recharge}.** The ravenfolk doom croaker caws a prophecy that sounds different to each listener. Each creature within 30 feet of the ravenfolk that can hear it must make a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw. Ravenfolk have advantage on the saving throw. On a failure, a creature hears a prophecy of its doom and is {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. On a success, a creature hears a prophecy of its greatness and has advantage on the first attack roll it makes on each of its turns for 1 minute. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
