**Multiattack.** The hybrid makes two attacks: one with its shocking touch and one with its tentacles.

**Shocking Touch.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 2d8}) lightning damage.

**Tentacles.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. {@h}The target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 11}), and the hybrid pulls the target up to 15 feet straight toward it. Until this grapple ends, the target takes 5 ({@damage 1d10}) lightning damage at the start of each of its turns, and the hybrid shocker can't use its tentacles on another creature.
