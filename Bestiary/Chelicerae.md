**Multiattack.** The chelicerae makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. It can replace the Bite attack with a use of Spellcasting.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d10 + 6}) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or become {@condition poisoned} for 1 minute. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature and the chelicerae doesn't have another creature {@condition grappled}, the target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 15}). A {@condition poisoned} target is also {@condition unconscious} while {@condition poisoned} in this way. The {@condition poisoned} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the {@condition poisoned} condition on itself on a success.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d8 + 6}) slashing damage.

**Magical Discharge (Recharge Special).** The chelicerae releases some of its stored magical energy in a burst. Each creature within 15 feet of the chelicerae must make a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 ({@damage 8d8}) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After using Magical Discharge, the chelicerae can't do so again until it successfully siphons magic from a creature or until it finishes a long rest.
