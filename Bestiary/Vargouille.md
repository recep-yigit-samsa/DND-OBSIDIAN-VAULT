**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d6 + 2}) piercing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) poison damage.

**Kiss.** The vargouille kisses one {@condition incapacitated} humanoid within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a {@dc 12} Charisma saving throw or become cursed. The cursed target loses 1 point of Charisma after each hour, as its head takes on fiendish aspects. The curse doesn't advance while the target is in sunlight or the area of a {@spell daylight} spell; don't count that time. When the cursed target's Charisma becomes 2, it dies, and its head tears from its body and becomes a new vargouille. Casting {@spell remove curse}, {@spell greater restoration}, or a similar spell on the target before the transformation is complete can end the curse. Doing so undoes the changes made to the target by the curse.

**Stunning Shriek.** The vargouille shrieks. Each humanoid and beast within 30 feet of the vargouille and able to hear it must succeed on a {@dc 12} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} until the end of the vargouille's next turn. While {@condition frightened} in this way, a target is {@condition stunned}. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the Stunning Shriek of all vargouilles for 1 hour.
