**Multiattack.** The slasher makes two Slasher's Knife attacks.

**Slasher's Knife.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/60 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d4 + 4}) slashing damage plus 21 ({@damage 6d6}) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it suffers a lingering wound that causes it to take 7 ({@damage 2d6}) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. Each time the slasher hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 3 ({@damage 1d6}). The wound ends if the target regains hit points or if a creature uses an action to stanch the wound, which requires a successful {@dc 15} Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check.
