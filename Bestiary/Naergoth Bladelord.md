**Life Drain.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 5d6 + 3}) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
