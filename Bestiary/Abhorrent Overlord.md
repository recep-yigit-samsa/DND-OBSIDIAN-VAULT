**Multiattack.** The abhorrent overlord makes two attacks with its claws.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d8 + 5}) slashing damage plus 14 ({@damage 4d6}) necrotic damage. The abhorrent overlord regains hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt if the target is a creature.

**Storm of Crows {@recharge}.** The abhorrent overlord conjures a swarm of spectral crows and harpies in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the overlord can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere remains for 1 minute or until the overlord loses {@status concentration} (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell), and its area is lightly obscured and {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. Any creature that moves into the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 16 ({@damage 3d10}) slashing damage plus 16 ({@damage 3d10}) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
