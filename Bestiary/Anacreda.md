**Multiattack.** Anacreda makes two Claw attacks. She can replace one of the attacks with a Crushing Hug attack.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d8 + 7}) slashing damage.

**Crushing Hug.** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}51 ({@damage 8d10 + 7}) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature, Anacreda grabs it with both arms. The target has the {@condition grappled} condition (escape {@dc 18}). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 73 ({@damage 12d10 + 7}) necrotic damage at the start of each of Anacreda's turns. Anacreda can't make attacks while grappling a creature in this way.

**Spinewall.** Anacreda causes a 50-foot-long, 5-foot-wide row of bones to pierce the earth at a point within 120 feet of her. She chooses the direction of the line. The bones rise 10 feet into the air and form a solid wall. A 5-foot section of bone has an AC of 20 and 10 hit points.

**Shattering Shriek (1/Day).** Anacreda shrieks loud enough to shatter stone and bone alike. Each creature within a 50-foot-radius sphere centered on Anacreda must make a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 55 ({@damage 10d10}) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Unworked stone, exposed bone, and similar materials in the radius are shattered and turned into difficult terrain.
