**Multiattack.** Bavlorna makes one Bite attack and one Withering Ray attack.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d6 + 6}) piercing damage, and the target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 16}) if it is a Medium or smaller creature. Until the grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained}, and Bavlorna can't use her Bite attack on another target.

**Withering Ray.** {@atk rs} {@hit 6} to hit, range 60 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 4d6 + 3}) necrotic damage.

**Create Lornlings {@recharge 5}.** Bavlorna creates one or two 1-foot-tall duplicates of herself, called lornlings (use the Quickling stat block in appendix C). Each lornling appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of Bavlorna, obeys her commands, and takes its turn immediately after hers. A lornling lasts for 1 hour, until it or Bavlorna dies, or until Bavlorna dismisses it as an action. Bavlorna can have no more than eight lornlings in existence at a time.
