|---------|--------|----------------|--------------------|
| Multiattack | - | 17 | - |

**Multiattack.** The mask wight makes two Khopesh of Oblivion attacks and one Spiked Gauntlet attack. If both Khopesh of Oblivion attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw or forget cherished memories of one object or location until it interacts with that object or location again. The object or location can't be an object on the target or a location within its sight when it fails this saving throw.

**Khopesh of Oblivion.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d8 + 6}) slashing damage plus 13 ({@damage 3d8}) necrotic damage.

**Spiked Gauntlet.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d6 + 6}) bludgeoning damage plus 13 ({@damage 3d8}) necrotic damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 17} Strength saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}.

**Wail of the Forgotten {@recharge}.** The mask wight emits an earâ€‘piercing wail. Each creature within 30 feet of the mask wight must make a {@dc 17} Charisma saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 ({@damage 10d6}) thunder damage and 27 ({@damage 6d8}) psychic damage and is {@condition deafened} for 1 hour. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't {@condition deafened}. A creature killed by this wail is erased from the memories of every creature in the planes that ever saw or interacted with it, all written or pictorial references to the target fade away, and its body is obliterated. Only divine beings and creatures that saw the creature die are unaffected by this memory erasure. The slain creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a {@spell wish} spell.
