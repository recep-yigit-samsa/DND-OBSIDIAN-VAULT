**Multiattack.** Xenk makes three Daggersword attacks and uses Daggersword Flourish. He can replace Daggersword Flourish with Cleansing Touch if it's available.

**Daggersword.** Choose the attack that corresponds to the daggersword's current form (see Daggersword Shift below):

**Longsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) slashing damage, or 9 ({@damage 1d10 + 4}) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 6 ({@damage 1d12}) radiant damage.

**Shortsword and Dagger.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) piercing damage plus 6 ({@damage 1d12}) radiant damage.

**Daggersword Flourish.** Choose the option that corresponds to the daggersword's current form (see Daggersword Shift below):

**Longsword.** Xenk magically detaches the longsword's blade from its hilt, launching the blade at a creature he can see within 30 feet of himself. The target must make a {@dc 16} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is impaled by the blade, taking 14 ({@damage 3d6 + 4}) piercing damage, and is knocked {@condition prone}. At the end of the current turn, the blade magically reattaches to its hilt.

**Shortsword and Dagger.** Xenk lashes out with both weapons. Each creature of his choice within 10 feet of him must make a {@dc 16} Dexterity throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7 ({@damage 2d6}) piercing damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of Xenk's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effect.

**Cleansing Touch (1/Day).** Xenk touches a creature within 5 feet of himself. The target magically regains 27 ({@dice 6d8}) hit points and gains the benefit of a {@spell lesser restoration} spell.
