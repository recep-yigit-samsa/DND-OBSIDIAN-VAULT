**Multiattack.** The vitebriate makes two melee attacks.

**Dagger.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one creature. {@h}4 ({@damage 1d4 + 2}) piercing damage.

**Dominate Person.** A vitebriate can target a single humanoid with dominate person as the spell, with the following differences: once the vitebriate has chosen the target, it can use this ability only on the chosen target (until the next day when it can choose a different target and drop the focus on the current target). The spell does not require {@status concentration} but is broken if the vitebriate is knocked {@condition unconscious} involuntarily or killed (though not if it trances or sleeps). If the person has been {@condition charmed} for at least an hour, damage does not force a new saving throw.
