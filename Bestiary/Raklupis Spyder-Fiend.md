**Multiattack.** The raklupis makes a Bite attack and two Serrated Sword attacks. It can use Venom Globe in place of one of these attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d10 + 5}) piercing damage plus 18 ({@damage 4d8}) poison damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 20} Constitution saving throw or have the {@condition poisoned} condition for 1 minute. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, a creature has the {@condition incapacitated} condition and can't regain hit points. A {@condition poisoned} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Serrated Sword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}19 ({@damage 4d6 + 5}) slashing damage plus 18 ({@damage 4d8}) poison damage.
