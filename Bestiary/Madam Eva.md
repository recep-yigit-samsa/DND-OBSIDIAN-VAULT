**Curse (Recharges after a Long Rest).** Madam Eva targets one creature that she can see within 30 feet of her. The target must succeed on a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw or be cursed. While cursed, the target is {@condition blinded} and {@condition deafened}. The curse lasts until ended with a {@spell greater restoration} spell, a {@spell remove curse} spell, or similar magic. When the curse ends, Madam Eva takes {@damage 5d6} psychic damage.

**Evil Eye (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** Madam Eva targets one creature that she can see within 10 feet of her and casts one of the following spells on the target (save {@dc 17}), requiring neither somatic nor material components to do so: {@spell animal friendship}, {@spell charm person}, or {@spell hold person}. If the target succeeds on the initial saving throw, Madam Eva is {@condition blinded} until the end of her next turn. Once a target succeeds on a saving throw against this effect, it is immune to the Evil Eye power of all Vistani for 24 hours.
