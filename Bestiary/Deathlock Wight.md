**Multiattack.** The wight attacks twice with Grave Bolt.

**Grave Bolt.** {@atk rs} {@hit 5} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d8 + 3}) necrotic damage.

**Life Drain.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}9 ({@damage 2d6 + 2}) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a {@creature zombie} under the wight's control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The wight can have no more than twelve {@creature zombie||zombies} under its control at one time.
