**Multiattack.** The guardian makes two Moonlight Slam attacks.

**Moonlight Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage plus 4 ({@damage 1d8}) radiant damage.

**Moonlight Blast {@recharge 5}.** The guardian unleashes a magical blast of moonlight in a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 14} Dexterity saving throw. Creatures that aren't in their true form have disadvantage on the save. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 ({@damage 5d8}) radiant damage, and if it isn't in its true form, it is forced into its true form and can't change forms until the end of the guardian's next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.
