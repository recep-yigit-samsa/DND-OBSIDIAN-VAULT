**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) fire damage.

**Charm.** One humanoid the flame can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw or be magically {@condition charmed} for 1 day. The {@condition charmed} target obeys the flame's verbal or telepathic commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this flame's Charm for the next 24 hours. The flame can have only one target {@condition charmed} at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous target ends.

**Draining Kiss.** The flame kisses a creature {@condition charmed} by it or a willing creature. The target must make a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 32 ({@damage 5d10 + 5}) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
