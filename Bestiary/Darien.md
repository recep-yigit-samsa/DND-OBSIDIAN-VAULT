**Multiattack.** Darien makes two War Pick attacks.

**War Pick.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 1d8 + 6}) piercing damage plus 4 necrotic damage.

**Eldritch Blast.** {@atk rs} {@hit 8} to hit, range 300 ft., three targets. {@h}9 ({@damage 1d10 + 4}) force damage.

**Create Thrall.** Darien touches an {@condition incapacitated} Humanoid. That creature is then {@condition charmed} by her until a {@spell remove curse} spell is cast on it, the {@condition charmed} condition is removed from it, or she uses this feature again. Darien can communicate telepathically with the {@condition charmed} creature as long as the two of them are on the same plane of existence.

**Summon War Pick.** Darien creates a magical war pick in her empty hand. The war pick counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The war pick has a +1 bonus to attack and damage (already factored into Darien's attacks).
