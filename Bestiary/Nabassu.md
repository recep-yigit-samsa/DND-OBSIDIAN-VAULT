**Multiattack.** The nabassu uses its Soul-Stealing Gaze and makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its bite.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d10 + 6}) slashing damage.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}32 ({@damage 4d12 + 6}) piercing damage.

**Soul-Stealing Gaze.** The nabassu targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the nabassu and isn't a construct or an undead, it must succeed on a {@dc 16} Charisma saving throw or reduce its hit point maximum by 13 ({@damage 2d12}) damage and give the nabassu an equal number of temporary hit points. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0, and if the target is a humanoid, it immediately rises as a {@creature ghoul} under the nabassu's control.
