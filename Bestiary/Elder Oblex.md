**Multiattack.** The elder oblex makes two pseudopod attacks and uses Eat Memories.

**Pseudopod.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 4d6 + 3}) bludgeoning damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) psychic damage.

**Eat Memories.** The oblex targets one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a {@dc 18} Wisdom saving throw or take 44 ({@damage 8d10}) psychic damage and become memory drained until it finishes a short or long rest or until it benefits from the {@spell greater restoration} or {@spell heal} spell. Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead succeed on the save automatically. While memory drained, the target must roll a {@dice d4} and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the {@dice d4} becomes a {@dice d6}, the {@dice d6} becomes a {@dice d8}, and so on until the die becomes a {@dice d20}, at which point the target becomes {@condition unconscious} for 1 hour. The effect then ends. When an oblex causes a target to become memory drained, the oblex learns all the languages the target knows and gains all its proficiencies, except any saving throw proficiencies.
