**Multiattack.** The giant makes three Prism Staff attacks.

**Prism Staff.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 3d6 + 6}) bludgeoning damage plus 13 ({@damage 3d8}) radiant damage.

**Exploding Geode.** The giant throws a geode at a point within 60 feet of itself, and the geode explodes in a dazzling flash. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a {@dc 17} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 13 ({@damage 3d8}) piercing damage plus 13 ({@damage 3d8}) radiant damage and has the {@condition blinded} condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. After the giant throws the geode, roll a {@dice d6}; on a roll of 4 or lower, the giant has no more geodes to throw.

**Prismatic Rays (Requires Stone Rune).** The giant's stone rune emits beams of light that form a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 17} Dexterity saving throw. For each creature in that area, roll a {@dice d6} to determine what ray affects it:

**1-2: Blazing Red.** On a failed save, the creature takes 35 ({@damage 10d6}) radiant damage and has the {@condition blinded} condition until the end of the giant's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

**3-4: Dreadful Blue.** On a failed save, the creature takes 35 ({@damage 10d6}) necrotic damage and has the {@condition frightened} condition until the end of the giant's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

**5-6: Sapping Green.** On a failed save, the creature takes 35 ({@damage 10d6}) force damage and has the {@condition incapacitated} condition until the end of the giant's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.
