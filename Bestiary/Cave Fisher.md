**Multiattack.** The cave fisher makes two attacks with its claws.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) slashing damage.

**Filament.** One creature {@condition grappled} by the cave fisher's adhesive filament must make a {@dc 13} Strength saving throw, provided that the target weighs 200 pounds or less. On a failure, the target is pulled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the cave fisher, and the cave fisher makes a claw attack against it as a bonus action. Reeling up the target releases anyone else who was attached to the filament. Until the grapple ends on the target, the cave fisher can't extrude another filament.
