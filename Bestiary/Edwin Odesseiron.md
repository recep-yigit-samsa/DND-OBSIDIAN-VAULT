**Multiattack.** Edwin makes a Staff of Power attack or uses Spellcasting or Staff Spellcasting. He then makes two Elemental Blast attacks.

**Staff of Power.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d6 + 2}) bludgeoning damage or 6 ({@damage 1d8 + 2}) bludgeoning damage if wielded with two hands. Edwin can expend one of the staff's charges to deal an extra 14 ({@damage 4d6}) force damage on a hit.

**Elemental Blast.** {@atk rs} {@hit 12} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}38 ({@damage 6d10 + 5}) acid, cold, lightning, or fire damage.

**Edwin's Choking Cloud {@recharge}.** Edwin creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous fog centered on a point within 120 feet. The cloud spreads around corners but lasts only until the start of Edwin's next turn. When a creature enters the cloud's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 45 ({@damage 10d8}) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.
