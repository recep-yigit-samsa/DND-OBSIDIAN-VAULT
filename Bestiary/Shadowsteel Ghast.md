**Multiattack.** The Shadowsteel ghast makes two claw attacks or casts one at-will spell and makes one claw attack.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d8 + 3}) slashing damage and 7 ({@damage 2d6}) necrotic damage. A cursed target must make an escalation check. If a target drops to 0 hit points due to this damage and isn't already cursed, they are randomly afflicted with one from among any of the curses in the Grim Hollow Campaign Guide (GM's choice).
