**Multiattack.** The cradle makes three Slam or Hurl Lava attacks in any combination.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 17} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}31 ({@damage 4d10 + 9}) bludgeoning damage plus 14 ({@damage 4d6}) fire damage.

**Hurl Lava.** {@atk rw} {@hit 17} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}27 ({@damage 4d8 + 9}) fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites. Until a creature within 5 feet of the fire takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 10 ({@damage 3d6}) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Erupting Breath {@recharge 5}.** The cradle exhales flames and volcanic gases in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 24} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 55 ({@damage 10d10}) fire damage and has the {@condition poisoned} condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature {@condition poisoned} in this way can make a {@dc 24} Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
