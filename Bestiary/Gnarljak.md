| Ability | Damage | Save DC & Type | On Successful Save |
|---------|--------|----------------|--------------------|

**Multiattack.** The gnarljak makes one Gnawing Bite attack and two Chain Tail attacks, or it makes three Chain Tail attacks.

**Gnawing Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d8 + 5}) piercing damage, and the gnarljak attaches to the target. While attached, the gnarljak can't make Gnawing Bite attacks, and at the start of each of the gnarljak's turns, the target takes 14 ({@damage 2d8 + 5}) piercing damage. The attached gnarljak moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the gnarljak's movement. It can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the gnarljak by succeeding on a {@dc 16} Strength check.

**Chain Tail.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) bludgeoning damage.
