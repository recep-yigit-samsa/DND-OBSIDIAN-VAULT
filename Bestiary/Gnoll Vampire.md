**Multiattack (Vampire Form Only).** The vampire makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite (Hyena or Vampire Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) piercing damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. the target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

**Claws (Vampire Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d4 + 5}) slashing damage.

**Frightful Cackle (Hyena or Vampire Form Only).** The vampire emits a bone-chilling cackle. Each creature of the vampire's choice that is within 120 feet of the vampire and can hear its cackle must succeed on a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the vampire's Frightful Cackle for the next 24 hours.

**Sickening Gaze (Hyena or Vampire Form Only).** The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw against this magic or be {@condition poisoned} for 24 hours. A creature whose saving throw is successful is immune to this vampire's Sickening Gaze for 24 hours.
