If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 20}) and is {@condition restrained} until this grapple ends. The aspect can have only one creature {@condition grappled} this way at a time.

**Tail.** {@atk mw} {@hit 19} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}23 ({@damage 2d12 + 10}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 27} Strength saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}.

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
