**Multiattack.** The giant makes two attacks with its greatclub.

**Greatclub.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}19 ({@damage 3d8 + 6}) bludgeoning damage.

**Petrifying Touch.** The giant touches one Medium or smaller creature within 10 feet of it that is {@condition charmed} by it. The target must make a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes {@condition petrified}, and the giant can adhere the target to its stony body. {@spell Greater restoration} spells and other magic that can undo petrification have no effect on a {@condition petrified} creature on the giant unless the giant is dead, in which case the magic works normally, freeing the {@condition petrified} creature as well as ending the {@condition petrified} condition on it.

**Rock.** {@atk rw} {@hit 10} to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. {@h}28 ({@damage 4d10 + 6}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 17} Strength saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}.
