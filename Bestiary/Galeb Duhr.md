**Avalanche Slam.** {@atkr m} {@hit 8}, reach 5 ft. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature and the galeb duhr moved 20+ feet straight toward it immediately before the hit, the target takes an extra 7 ({@damage 2d6}) Bludgeoning damage and has the {@condition Prone|XPHB} condition.

**Animate Boulders (1/Day).** The galeb duhr magically animates one or two boulders it can see within 60 feet of itself. Each boulder uses the Galeb Duhr stat block, except it has Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1 and lacks this action. The boulder takes its turn immediately after the galeb duhr on the same {@variantrule Initiative|XPHB} count, and it obeys the galeb duhr. A boulder remains animate for 1 minute or until it or the galeb duhr dies.
