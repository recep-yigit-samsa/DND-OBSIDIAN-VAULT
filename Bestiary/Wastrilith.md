**Multiattack.** The wastrilith uses Grasping Spout and makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}30 ({@damage 4d12 + 4}) piercing damage.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 4d6 + 4}) slashing damage.

**Grasping Spout.** The wastrilith magically launches a spout of water at one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a {@dc 17} Strength saving throw, and it has disadvantage if it's underwater. On a failed save, it takes 22 ({@damage 4d8 + 4}) acid damage and is pulled up to 60 feet toward the wastrilith. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.
