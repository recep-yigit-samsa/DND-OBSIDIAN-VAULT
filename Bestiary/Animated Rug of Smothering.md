**Smother.** {@atkr m} {@hit 5}, reach 5 ft. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, the rug can give it the {@condition Grappled|XPHB} condition (escape {@dc 13}) instead of dealing damage. Until the grapple ends, the target has the {@condition Blinded|XPHB} and {@condition Restrained|XPHB} conditions, is suffocating, and takes 10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) Bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. The rug can smother only one creature at a time. While grappling the target, the rug can't take this action, the rug halves the damage it takes (round down), and the target takes the same amount of damage.
