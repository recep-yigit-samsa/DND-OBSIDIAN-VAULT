**Gore.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) piercing damage, or 13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) piercing damage while enlarged. If the minotaur moved at least 10 feet straight toward the target immediately before it hit, the target takes an extra 4 ({@damage 1d8}) piercing damage, or 9 ({@damage 2d8}) piercing damage if the minotaur is enlarged. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 14} Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet from the minotaur and have the {@condition prone} condition.

**Mattock.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 1d12 + 4}) bludgeoning damage, or 17 ({@damage 2d12 + 4}) bludgeoning damage while enlarged. If the target is a creature and the minotaur is enlarged, the target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Strength saving throw or have the {@condition prone} condition.

**Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, the minotaur magically increases in size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. While enlarged, the minotaur is Large, doubles its damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks (included in the attacks), and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage. If the minotaur lacks the room to become Large, the minotaur doesn't change size.
