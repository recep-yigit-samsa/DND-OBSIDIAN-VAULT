**Multiattack.** The shadow makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) necrotic damage, plus 3 ({@damage 1d6}) psychic damage.

**Cloak of Shadows.** The shadow bends darkness around itself, and now has the {@condition invisible} condition for 1 minute. The invisibility ends if the shadow is subjected to a {@spell Daylight} spell or similar.

**Empathic Link.** The shadow attempts to form a link between itself and a creature it can see. The target must make a {@dc 16} Intelligence saving throw, taking 6 ({@damage 1d12}) psychic damage on a success. On a failed save, the creature and the shadow are linked. While linked, every time the shadow is damaged, the creature takes half of that damage as psychic damage. The creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 6 ({@damage 1d12}) psychic damage on a failed save, or ending the effect on a successful one.
