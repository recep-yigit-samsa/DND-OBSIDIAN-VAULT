**Multiattack.** The cavelight moss makes two Tendrils attacks. If both attacks hit a Large or smaller creature, the target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 15}). Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained}, and at the start of each of the target's turns, it must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of {@condition exhaustion}. The cavelight moss then gains 5 temporary hp. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw can't suffer further levels of {@condition exhaustion} from the cavelight moss's grapple for the next 24 hours. The cavelight moss can have only one creature {@condition grappled} at a time.

**Tendrils.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d10 + 5}) bludgeoning damage.
