**Multiattack.** The giant makes one Greatclub attack and uses Stone Bolas.

**Greatclub.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 3d8 + 5}) bludgeoning damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) thunder damage.

**Stone Bolas.** The giant conjures three stone balls connected by lines of magical force and throws them at one creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must make a {@dc 16} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the {@condition restrained} condition until the start of the giant's next turn, and the stones erupt in a burst of thunderous energy that deals 14 ({@damage 4d6}) thunder damage to the target and each creature within 10 feet of the target. On a successful save, the stones vanish without erupting.

**Stone Avalanche (Requires Hill Rune).** The giant conjures a hail of rocks in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point on the ground it can see within 120 feet of itself. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 16} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 28 ({@damage 8d6}) bludgeoning damage and has the {@condition prone} condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. The rocks turn the ground in that area into difficult terrain until the start of the giant's next turn, when the rocks vanish.
