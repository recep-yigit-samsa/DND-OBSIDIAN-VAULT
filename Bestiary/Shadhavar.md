**Multiattack.** The shadhavar makes one Gore attack and one Hooves attack.

**Gore.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d8 + 2}) piercing damage.

**Hooves.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 2d6 + 2}) bludgeoning damage.

**Darkness Aura (1/Day).** A 15-foot radius of magical darkness extends out from the shadhavar, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long as the shadhavar maintains {@status concentration}, up to 10 minutes (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). Darkvision can't penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.
