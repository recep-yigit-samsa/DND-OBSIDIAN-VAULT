**Multiattack.** Isolde makes two melee attacks or uses its Fire Ray twice.

**Nepenthe.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft.., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 1d8 + 7}) slashing damage, or 12 ({@damage 1d10 + 7}) slashing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack. If the target is a fiend or an undead, it takes an extra 11 ({@damage 2d10}) radiant damage.

**Fire Ray.** {@atk rs} {@hit 7} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 3d6}) fire damage.

**Fiendish Charm.** One humanoid Isolde can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or be magically {@condition charmed} for 1 day. The {@condition charmed} target obeys Isolde's spoken commands. If the target suffers any harm from Isolde or another creature or receives a suicidal command from Isolde, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Isolde's Fiendish Charm for the next 24 hours.
