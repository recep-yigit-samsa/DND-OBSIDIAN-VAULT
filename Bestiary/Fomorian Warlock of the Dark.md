**Multiattack.** The fomorian makes three Greatclub attacks. If the fomorian has its blood rune, it can replace one of these attacks with a use of Corrupting Hex.

**Greatclub.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}19 ({@damage 3d8 + 6}) bludgeoning damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) necrotic damage.

**Corrupting Hex (Requires Blood Rune).** The fomorian targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a {@dc 16} Charisma saving throw or take 27 ({@damage 6d8}) necrotic damage and become cursed for 24 hours. While cursed this way, the target's speed is reduced by half, and if it tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a {@dc 16} Intelligence check or the spell fails and is wasted.

**Eldritch Burst.** Magical energy explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the fomorian can see within 120 feet of itself. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 16} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 32 ({@damage 5d12}) force damage and has the {@condition prone} condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.
