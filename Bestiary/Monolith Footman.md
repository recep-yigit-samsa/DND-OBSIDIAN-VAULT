**Multiattack.** The footman makes two Shortsword attacks.

**Shortsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 2d6 + 2}) slashing damage plus 4 ({@damage 1d8}) cold damage or fire damage (the footman's choice). If the target is within a fey court or castle, the target must succeed on a {@dc 12} Charisma saving throw or become {@condition invisible}, silent, and {@condition paralyzed} for 1 minute, while an illusory version of the target under the footman's control remains visible and audible. The illusion shouts to the target's allies for a retreat or similar action. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself and destroying the illusory double on a success.
