**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 1d12 + 3}) piercing damage.

**Steam Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon turtle exhales steam in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw, taking 17 ({@damage 5d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage.
