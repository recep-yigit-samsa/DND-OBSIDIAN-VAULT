**Multiattack.** The abishai can use its Frightful Presence. It also makes three attacks: one with its morningstar, one with its claw, and one with its bite.

**Morningstar.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 1d8 + 6}) piercing damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d10 + 6}) slashing damage.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@damage 3d10 + 6}) piercing damage plus 38 ({@damage 7d10}) fire damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the abishai's choice that is within 120 feet and aware of it must succeed on a {@dc 18} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the abishai's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Incite Fanaticism.** The abishai chooses up to four of its allies within 60 feet of it that can see it. For 1 minute, each of those allies makes attack rolls with advantage and can't be {@condition frightened}.

**Power of the Dragon Queen.** The abishai targets one dragon it can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon must make a {@dc 18} Charisma saving throw. A chromatic dragon makes this save with disadvantage. On a successful save, the target is immune to the abishai's Power of the Dragon Queen for 1 hour. On a failed save, the target is {@condition charmed} by the abishai for 1 hour. While {@condition charmed} in this way, the target regards the abishai as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. This effect ends if the abishai or its companions deal damage to the target.
