**Multiattack.** The duergar makes three hammer or javelin attacks and uses Call to Attack, or Enlarge if it is available.

**Psychic-Attuned Hammer.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 1d10 + 4}) bludgeoning damage plus 5 ({@damage 1d10}) psychic damage, or 15 ({@damage 2d10 + 4}) bludgeoning damage plus 5 ({@damage 1d10}) psychic damage while enlarged,

**Javelin.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) piercing damage, or 11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) piercing damage while enlarged.

**Call to Attack.** Up to three allied duergar within 120 feet of this duergar that can hear it can each use their reaction to make one weapon attack.

**Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, the duergar magically increases in size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. While enlarged, the duergar is Large, doubles its damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks (included in the attacks), and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage. If the duergar lacks the room to become Large, it attains the maximum size possible in the space available.

**Invisibility {@recharge 4}.** The duergar magically turns {@condition invisible} for up to 1 hour or until it attacks, it casts a spell, it uses its Enlarge, or its {@status concentration} is broken (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). Any equipment the duergar wears or carries is {@condition invisible} with it.
