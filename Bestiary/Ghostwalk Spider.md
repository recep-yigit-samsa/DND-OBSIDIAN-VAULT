**Multiattack.** The ghostwalk spider makes one Bite attack and one Ghostly Snare attack, or it makes two Bite attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}21 ({@damage 3d10 + 5}) piercing damage. If the ghostwalk spider is in its true form, the target must make a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw, taking 13 ({@damage 3d8}) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hp, the target is stable but {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour, even after regaining hp, and is {@condition paralyzed} while {@condition poisoned} in this way.

**Ghostly Snare (Ghostwalk Form Only, Recharge 4-6).** {@atk rw} {@hit 9} to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. {@h}The target is {@condition restrained} by {@condition invisible} webbing. While {@condition restrained} in this way, the target is {@condition invisible}. As an action, the {@condition restrained} target can make a {@dc 15} Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 12; hp 15; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
