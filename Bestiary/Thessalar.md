**Dagger.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}3 ({@damage 1d4 + 1}) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is affected as if by the {@spell polymorph} spell, transforming into a random {@filter beast|bestiary|type=beast|miscellaneous=!swarm} or a creature it has seen within the last 24 hours (as chosen by the DM). This effect lasts until the target finishes a long rest.
