**Multiattack.** The aurumvorax makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d8 + 2}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature wearing armor of any type, the aurumvorax regains 4 ({@dice 1d6 + 1}) hit points.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d6 + 2}) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 12}). Until this grapple ends, the aurumvorax can't use its Claw attack on another target, and when it moves, it can drag the {@condition grappled} creature with it, without the aurumvorax's speed being halved.
