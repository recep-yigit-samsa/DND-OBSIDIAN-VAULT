**Multiattack.** The archon makes two Hammer of Justice attacks.

**Hammer of Justice.** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) bludgeoning damage plus 18 ({@damage 4d8}) force damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 18} Strength saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}.

**Pacifying Presence.** Each creature of the archon's choice that the archon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a {@dc 18} Wisdom saving throw, or else the target drops any weapons it is holding, ends its {@status concentration} on any spells or other effects, and becomes {@condition charmed} by the archon for 1 minute. The {@condition charmed} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the archon's Pacifying Presence for the next 24 hours.
