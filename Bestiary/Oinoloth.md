**Multiattack.** The oinoloth uses its Transfixing Gaze and makes two claw attacks.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 3d6 + 4}) slashing damage plus 22 ({@damage 4d10}) necrotic damage.

**Corrupted Healing {@recharge}.** The oinoloth touches one willing creature within 5 feet of it. The target regains all its hit points. In addition, the oinoloth can end one disease on the target or remove one of the following conditions from it: {@condition blinded}, {@condition deafened}, {@condition paralyzed}, or {@condition poisoned}. The target then gains 1 level of {@condition exhaustion}, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 7 ({@dice 2d6}). This reduction can be removed only by a {@spell wish} spell or by casting {@spell greater restoration} on the target three times within the same hour. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

**Teleport.** The oinoloth magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

**Transfixing Gaze.** The oinoloth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a {@dc 16} Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be {@condition charmed} until the end of the oinoloth's next turn. While {@condition charmed} in this way, the target is {@condition restrained}. If the target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the oinoloth's gaze for the next 24 hours.
