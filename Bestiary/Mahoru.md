**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 3d10 + 4}) slashing damage. If the mahoru scores a critical hit, the target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Strength saving throw or the mahoru bites off one of the target's limbs. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage.

**Roar.** The mahoru roars while above water or emits a loud, low thrum while underwater. Each creature within 30 feet of the mahoru that can hear the roar or thrum must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is also {@condition paralyzed} until the end of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Roar of all mahoru for the next 24 hours.
