**Multiattack.** The white ape makes one Bite attack and two Fist attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or contract the arcane wasting disease (see the Arcane Wasting trait).

**Fist.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d10 + 4}) bludgeoning damage.

**Frenzy {@recharge 5}.** The white ape lashes out wildly at nearby creatures, flailing and biting. Each creature within 10 feet of the white ape must make a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 ({@damage 10d6}) bludgeoning damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the ape. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't pushed. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw also has advantage on attack rolls against the white ape until the end of its next turn.
