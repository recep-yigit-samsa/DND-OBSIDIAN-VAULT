**Multiattack.** Ssendam makes three attacks: one with her Touch of Madness and two with her Chaos Staff.

**Touch of Madness.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 1d10 + 5}) slashing damage plus 11 ({@damage 2d10}) necrotic damage. A target that fails a {@dc 20} Charisma saving throw is inflicted with a random short-term madness. If it is already mad, the existing madness is replaced with a random long-term madness.

**Chaos Staff.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) bludgeoning damage plus 11 ({@damage 2d10}) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a {@dc 19} Constitution saving throw or have the {@condition stunned} condition for 1 minute. The target may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.

**Summon Slaadi (1/Day).** Ssendam summons {@dice 1d4 + 1} {@creature death slaad||death slaadi}. A summoned slaad appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Ssendam, acts as an ally of Ssendam, and can't summon other slaadi. It remains for 1 minute, until it or Ssendam dies, or until Ssendam dismisses it as an action.

**Teleport.** Ssendam magically teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space she can see.
