Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 15} Strength saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 35 ({@damage 10d6}) force damage and is pulled up to 20 feet toward the sphere's center, and is knocked {@condition prone}. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled or knocked {@condition prone}.
