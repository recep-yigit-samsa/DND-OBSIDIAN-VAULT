**Multiattack.** The druid makes two melee attacks.

**Ice Sickle (Humanoid Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}3 ({@damage 1d4 + 1}) slashing damage plus 5 ({@damage 2d4}) cold damage.

**Maul (Beast Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}3 ({@damage 1d4 + 1}) piercing damage.

**Change Shape.** The druid magically polymorphs into a beast form—fox, mountain goat, owl, or wolf—or back into its humanoid form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the beast form (the druid's choice). It reverts to its humanoid form when it dies. The druid's statistics are the same in each form, except where noted in this stat block.
