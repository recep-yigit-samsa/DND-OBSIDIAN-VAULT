**Multiattack.** The molydeus makes three attacks: one with its weapon, one with its wolf bite, and one with its snakebite.

**Demonic Weapon.** {@atk mw} {@hit 16} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 2d10 + 9}) slashing damage. If the target has at least one head and the molydeus rolled a 20 on the attack roll, the target is decapitated and dies if it can't survive without that head. A target is immune to this effect if it takes none of the damage, has legendary actions, or is Huge or larger. Such a creature takes an extra {@damage 6d8} slashing damage from the hit.

**Wolf Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 16} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d6 + 9}) piercing damage.

**Snakebite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 16} to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. {@h}12 ({@damage 1d6 + 9}) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 22} Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target transforms into a {@creature manes} if this reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This transformation can be ended only by a {@spell wish} spell.
