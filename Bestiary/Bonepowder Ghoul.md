**Multiattack.** The bonepowder ghoul makes two Bite attacks. It can replace one Bite attack with a use of Gravedust or Spellcasting. If both Bite attacks hit the same creature, the target must succeed on a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition paralyzed} for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 3d8 + 5}) piercing damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage, and the target's Strength score is reduced by {@dice 1d4}. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. If the target is a Humanoid, it must succeed on a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw or contract the darakhul fever disease.

**Gravedust.** The ghoul projects a 30-foot cone of grave dust. Each creature in the area must succeed on a {@dc 17} Dexterity saving throw or take 13 ({@damage 3d8}) necrotic damage. If a creature is a Humanoid, it must also succeed on a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw or contract the darakhul fever disease.

**Whirlwind (Dust Form Only; Recharge 5-6).** The ghoul creates a whirlwind of bones and teeth in a 20-foot cube originating from it. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 17} Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 55 ({@damage 10d10}) slashing damage, and its Strength score is reduced by {@dice 1d6}. The creature dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and its Strength score isn't reduced.
