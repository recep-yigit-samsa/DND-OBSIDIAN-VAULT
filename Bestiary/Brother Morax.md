**Multiattack.** Morax makes four attacks using his Claw, Spine Fling, or a combination of the two.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 14} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 3d6 + 7}) slashing damage, and the target gains 1 Brittle Spine.

**Spine Fling.** {@atk rw} {@hit 13} to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 1d12 + 6}) piercing damage, and the target gains 1 Brittle Spine.

**Deep Burrow.** Morax immediately deals Brittle Spine ongoing damage to all creatures that have at least one Brittle Spine that he can see.

**Bone Spikes {@recharge}.** Morax shoves an arm into the ground, rapidly growing bones that erupt at a point he can see within 100 feet of him. Each creature in a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a {@dc 21} Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 ({@damage 8d6}) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail the save gain 2 Brittle Spines, while creatures that succeed only gain 1 Brittle Spine.
