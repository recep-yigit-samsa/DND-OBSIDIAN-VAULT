**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d10 + 3}) piercing damage plus 4 ({@damage 1d8}) radiant damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) slashing damage.

**Scintillating Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a burst of brilliant radiance in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw, taking 27 ({@damage 6d8}) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The dragon then gains 10 temporary hit points by absorbing a portion of the radiant energy.
