**Multiattack.** Velomachus makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 18} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 1d10 + 10}) piercing damage plus 6 ({@damage 1d12}) thunder damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 18} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 1d6 + 10}) slashing damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it is knocked {@condition prone}.

**Battle Tide Breath {@recharge 5}.** Velomachus exhales thunderous sound in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 25} Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 45 ({@damage 7d12}) force damage and 45 ({@damage 7d12}) thunder damage and is pushed up to 20 feet in a horizontal direction of Velomachus' choice. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed. Objects that aren't being worn or carried take the damage and are pushed as if they were creatures that failed the saving throw.
