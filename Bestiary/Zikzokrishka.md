**Multiattack.** Zikzokrishka can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 2d10 + 7}) piercing damage plus 5 ({@damage 1d10}) lightning damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d6 + 7}) slashing damage.

**Tail.** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d8 + 7}) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of Zikzokrishka's choice that is within 120 feet of the Zikzokrishka and aware of it must succeed on a {@dc 18} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Zikzokrishka's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Lightning Breath {@recharge 5}.** Zikzokrishka exhales lightning in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a {@dc 20} Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 ({@damage 12d10}) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
