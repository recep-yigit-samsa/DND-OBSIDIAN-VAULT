**Multiattack.** Delour makes any combination of three Bite, Shortsword, or Hand Crossbow attacks.

**Bite (Rat or Hybrid Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}26 ({@damage 5d8 + 4}) piercing damage. If the target is a Humanoid, it must succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw or be cursed with lycanthropy. While cursed in this way, the target retains its alignment, languages, and equipment but otherwise uses the wererat stat block, excluding actions that require equipment the target doesn't have. During any night when there's a full moon in the sky, the target becomes an NPC under the DM's control and remains so until the night ends. A {@spell Remove Curse} spell or similar magic ends this curse.

**Shortsword (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only).** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) piercing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) poison damage.

**Hand Crossbow (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only).** {@atk rw} {@hit 8} to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) piercing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) poison damage.
