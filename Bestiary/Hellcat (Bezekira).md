**Multiattack.** The bezekira makes three Claw attacks. It can replace one of the attacks with a Bite attack.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 3d6 + 5}) slashing damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) fire damage. The bezekira deals an extra 28 ({@damage 8d6}) fire damage when it hits a target with an attack and has advantage on the attack roll.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d10 + 5}) bludgeoning damage, grasping the target with its mouth. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the {@condition grappled} condition (escape {@dc 17}). The bezekira can't make a Bite attack while a creature is {@condition grappled} in this way.
