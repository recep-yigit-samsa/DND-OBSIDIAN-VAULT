**Multiattack.** Camazotz makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 17} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}38 ({@damage 8d6 + 10}) piercing damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) fire damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 22} Constitution saving throw or its Strength score is reduced by {@dice 1d4}. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. A Humanoid that dies from this reduction rises {@dice 1d4} days later as a vampire under Camazotz's control, unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. Camazotz can have no more than five vampires under his control at a time.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 17} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}31 ({@damage 6d6 + 10}) slashing damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) fire damage.

**Fire Breath {@recharge 5}.** Camazotz exhales unholy fire in a 30â€‘foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a {@dc 22} Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 ({@damage 6d10}) fire damage and 33 ({@damage 6d10}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Call Bats (3/Day).** Camazotz magically calls {@dice 4d6} giant bats or swarms of bats, or he magically calls {@dice 2d6} vrocks that have membranous instead of feathered wings. The called creatures arrive in {@dice 1d4} rounds, acting as allies of Camazotz and obeying his telepathic commands. The creatures remain for 1 hour, until Camazotz dies, or until Camazotz dismisses them as a bonus action. Camazotz can have no more than twenty four giant bats or swarms of bats, or twelve vrocks under his control at a time.
