**Multiattack.** Coral makes two Hoof attacks and uses Tail Thump.

**Hoof.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) bludgeoning damage.

**Tail Thump.** Coral slams her tail down, unleashing a burst of magical force toward one creature she can see within 60 feet of her. The target must make a {@dc 16} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 ({@damage 4d10}) force damage and has the {@condition prone} condition. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target dies, and its body is reduced to fine dust.
