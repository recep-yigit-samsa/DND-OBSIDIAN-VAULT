**Multiattack.** Mechuiti can use his Frightful Presence. He then makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 17} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}31 ({@damage 4d10 + 9}) piercing damage plus 21 ({@damage 6d6}) fire damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 17} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}27 ({@damage 4d8 + 9}) slashing damage plus 21 ({@damage 6d6}) fire damage. If Mechuiti scores a critical hit, he rolls damage dice three times, instead of twice.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of Mechuiti's choice that is within 120 feet of Mechuiti and aware of him must succeed on a {@dc 24} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Mechuiti's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Burning Acid Breath {@recharge 5}.** Mechuiti exhales fire and acid in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 24} Dexterity saving throw, taking 49 ({@damage 14d6}) fire damage and 49 ({@damage 14d6}) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
