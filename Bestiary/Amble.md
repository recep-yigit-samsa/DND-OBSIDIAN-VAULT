**Change Shape (2/Day).** Amble magically polymorphs into a beast with a challenge rating of 1 or less, and can remain in this form for up to 6 hours. Amble's equipment melds with their new form. Amble reverts to their true form if they die or fall {@condition unconscious}. Amble can revert to their true form using a bonus action on their turn. Amble's game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but they retain their alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Amble also retains all their skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as Amble and the bonus in its stat block is higher, use the creature's bonus instead of Amble's. When Amble transforms, they assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When Amble reverts to their normal form, they return to the number of hit points they had before they transformed. However, if Amble reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over their normal form. Amble can't cast spells, and their ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of their beast form. Transforming doesn't break Amble's {@status concentration} on a spell they've already cast however, or prevent them from taking actions that are part of a spell.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}4 ({@damage 1d4 + 2}) slashing damage.

**Club.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit ({@hit 8} to hit with shillelagh), reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d6 + 2}) bludgeoning damage, or 8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage with shillelagh.
