**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and uses Beating Wings.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 14} to hit; reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 3d6 + 8}) piercing damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) necrotic damage.

**Beating Wings.** The dragon beats its great wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a {@dc 21} Dexterity saving throw or take 10 ({@damage 1d4 + 8}) bludgeoning damage, be pushed 10 feet away from the dragon, and have the {@condition prone} condition.

**Harmful Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales putrid gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 21} Constitution saving throw, taking 52 ({@damage 15d6}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The dragon then chooses a point it can see where the cone makes contact with the ground. That point becomes the center of a 10-foot-high, 10-foot-radius cylinder of lingering gas that disappears at the start of the dragon's next turn. Any creature that starts its turn in the cylinder takes 10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage.
