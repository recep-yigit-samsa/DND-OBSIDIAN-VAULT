**Multiattack.** The automata devil makes one Bite attack, one Whip attack, and two Claw attacks. It can replace two Claw attacks with a use of Shredding Maw.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 2d10 + 7}) slashing damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d8 + 7}) slashing damage.

**Whip.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d4 + 7}) slashing damage, and the target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 17}). The automata devil has two whips, each of which can grapple only one target.

**Shredding Maw.** One creature {@condition grappled} by the automata devil is pulled up to 10 feet toward the devil's central maw, which shreds the creature with churning gears, razor teeth, and whirling blades. The target must make a {@dc 17} Strength saving throw, taking 36 ({@damage 8d8}) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Teleport.** The automata devil magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
