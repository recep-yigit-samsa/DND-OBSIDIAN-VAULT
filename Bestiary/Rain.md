**Hoof.** {@atk mw} {@hit 3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 2d4}) bludgeoning damage.

**Haloed Horn Burst {@recharge 5}.** Rain uses her haloed horn to produce one of the following magical effects:

**Glitterstorm.** Rain emits a rainbow beam in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 ({@damage 6d6}) radiant damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one; creatures of evil alignment have disadvantage on this saving throw. If the damage from this effect reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the creature dies, and its body turns into glittery flowers.
