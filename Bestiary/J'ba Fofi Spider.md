**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d10 + 3}) piercing damage, and the target must make a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw, taking 18 ({@damage 4d8}) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hp, the target is stable but {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour, even after regaining hp, and is {@condition paralyzed} while {@condition poisoned} in this way.

**Call Spiderlings (1/Day).** The j'ba fofi releases pheromones and calls 1 swarm of spiders. The spiders arrive in {@dice 1d4} rounds, acting as allies of the j'ba fofi and obeying its pheromone commands. The spiders remain for 1 hour, until the j'ba fofi dies, or until the j'ba fofi dismisses them as a bonus action.
