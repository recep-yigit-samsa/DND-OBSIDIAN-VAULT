**Multiattack.** Sofina makes three Necrotic Strike attacks.

**Necrotic Strike.** {@atk ms,rs} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. {@h}32 ({@damage 5d10 + 5}) necrotic damage.

**Swarm of Meteors (1/Day).** Sofina magically calls down a meteor swarm that detonates in four 40-foot-radius spheres, each one centered on a point she can see within 1 mile of herself. These spheres can overlap. Each creature in one or more of these spheres must make a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 ({@damage 10d6}) fire damage and 35 ({@damage 10d6}) bludgeoning damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in multiple spheres takes this damage only once.
