**Multiattack.** Red Ruin makes three Ember Lance attacks.

**Ember Lance.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 1d12 + 4}) piercing damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) fire damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 16} Strength saving throw or fall {@condition prone}.

**Explosive Hand Crossbow {@recharge 5}.** Red Ruin fires an explosive crossbow bolt at a point she can see within 120 feet of herself. When the bolt reaches that point, or if it hits an object early, it detonates in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 ({@damage 10d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
