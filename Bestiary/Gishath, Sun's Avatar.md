**Multiattack.** Gishath makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its stomp or tail. It can't make both attacks against the same target.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}39 ({@damage 5d12 + 7}) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 19} Dexterity saving throw or it is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 19}). Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained}, and Gishath can't bite another target.

**Swallow.** Gishath makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is {@condition blinded} and {@condition restrained}, it has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects outside Gishath, and it takes 21 ({@damage 6d6}) acid damage at the start of each of Gishath's turns. If Gishath takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, it must succeed on a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall {@condition prone} in a space within 10 feet of it. If Gishath dies, a swallowed creature is no longer {@condition restrained} by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting {@condition prone}.

**Stomp.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}29 ({@damage 5d8 + 7}) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 19} Strength saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}.

**Tail.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}25 ({@damage 4d8 + 7}) bludgeoning damage.
