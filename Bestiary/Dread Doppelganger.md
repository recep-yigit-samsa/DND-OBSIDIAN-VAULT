**Multiattack.** The dread doppelganger makes three Slam attacks.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, range 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 1d8 + 6}).

**Read Thoughts.** The dread doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 feet of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 ft. of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the dread doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the dread doppelganger's Concentration isn't broken (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) and Charisma ({@skill Deception}, {@skill Intimidation}, and {@skill Persuasion}) checks against the target.
