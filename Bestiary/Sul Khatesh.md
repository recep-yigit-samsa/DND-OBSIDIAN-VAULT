**Multiattack.** Sul Khatesh makes four attacks with Arcane Blast.

**Arcane Blast.** {@atk rs} {@hit 18} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 1d10 + 10}) force damage.

**Magic Staff.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}36 ({@damage 5d12 + 4}) force damage.

**Arcane Cataclysm (Recharges after a Long Rest).** Sul Khatesh conjures orbs of magical energy that plummet to the ground at three different points she can see within 1 mile of her. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point must make a {@dc 26} Dexterity saving throw, taking 71 ({@damage 11d12}) force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one arcane burst is affected only once. The area of each arcane burst then acts as an {@spell antimagic field} for 1 hour. Sul Khatesh and spells she casts are unaffected by these fields.

**Change Shape.** Sul Khatesh magically polymorphs into a humanoid, beast, or giant that has a challenge rating no higher than her own, or back into her true form. She reverts to her true form if she dies. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (Sul Khatesh's choice). In a new form, Sul Khatesh retains her alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Her statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.
