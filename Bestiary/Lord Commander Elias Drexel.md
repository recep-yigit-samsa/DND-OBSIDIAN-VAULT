**Multiattack.** Elias Drexel uses Leadership. He then makes four attacks with either his longsword or his longbow.

**Longsword.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d8 + 7}) slashing damage.

**Longbow.** {@atk rw} {@hit 7} to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d8 + 2}) piercing damage.

**Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, Elias Drexel can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that he can see within 120 feet of him makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a {@dice d4} to its roll provided it can hear and understand Elias Drexel. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if Elias Drexel is {@condition incapacitated}.
