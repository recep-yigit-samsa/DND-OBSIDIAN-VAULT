**Multiattack.** Malaxxix makes two Forge Hammer or Whip attacks in any combination.

**Forge Hammer.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 10 ft. or range 60/180 ft., one target. {@h}28 ({@damage 4d10 + 6}) bludgeoning damage, and the target can't take reactions until the end of Malaxxix's next turn. {@hom}The hammer then magically returns to Malaxxix's hand.

**Whip.** {@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 30 ft., one creature. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d8 + 6}) slashing damage, and the target has the {@condition restrained} condition for 1 minute. The {@condition restrained} target can make a {@dc 20} Strength saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Only one creature can be {@condition restrained} by the whip at a time.

**Mezzoloth Vortex {@recharge 5}.** Malaxxix summons a vortex of whirling mezzoloths at a point it can see within 90 feet of itself. The vortex is a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Each creature other than Malaxxix in that area must make a {@dc 20} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 35 ({@damage 10d6}) force damage and has the {@condition restrained} condition while within the cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space outside the cylinder. The vortex lasts until the start of Malaxxix's next turn.
