**Multiattack.** The lich makes four attacks.

**Poisonous Touch.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. {@h}17 ({@damage 5d6}) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 19} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Wither.** {@atk rs} {@hit 9} to hit, range 60 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 4d6}) necrotic damage.

**Fire Storm (7th-Level Spell; 1/Day).** The lich fills up to ten 10-foot cubes with fire. Every cube must be within 150 feet of the lich and occupy a space the lich can see, and each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a {@dc 19} Dexterity saving throw, taking 38 ({@damage 7d10}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. If the lich chooses, plant life in the area is unaffected by the spell.
