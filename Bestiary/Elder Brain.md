**Tentacle.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 4d8 + 2}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 15}) and takes 9 ({@damage 1d8 + 5}) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns until the grapple ends. The elder brain can have up to four targets {@condition grappled} at a time.

**Mind Blast {@recharge 5}.** The elder brain magically emits psychic energy. Creatures of the elder brain's choice within 60 feet of it must succeed on a {@dc 18} Intelligence saving throw or take 32 ({@damage 5d10 + 5}) psychic damage and be {@condition stunned} for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Psychic Link.** The elder brain targets one {@condition incapacitated} creature it can perceive with its Creature Sense trait and establishes a psychic link with that creature. Until the psychic link ends, the elder brain can perceive everything the target senses. The target becomes aware that something is linked to its mind once it is no longer {@condition incapacitated}, and the elder brain can terminate the link at any time (no action required). The target can use an action on its turn to attempt to break the psychic link, doing so with a successful {@dc 18} Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes 10 ({@damage 3d6}) psychic damage. The psychic link also ends if the target and the elder brain are more than 5 miles apart, with no consequences to the target. The elder brain can form psychic links with up to ten creatures at a time.

**Sense Thoughts.** The elder brain targets a creature with which it has a psychic link. The elder brain gains insight into the target's reasoning, its emotional state, and thoughts that loom large in its mind (including things the target worries about, loves, or hates). The elder brain can also make a Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check with advantage to deceive the target's mind into thinking it believes one idea or feels a particular emotion. The target contests this attempt with a Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check. If the elder brain succeeds, the mind believes the deception for 1 hour or until evidence of the lie is presented to the target.
