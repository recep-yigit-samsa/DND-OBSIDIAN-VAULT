**Multiattack.** The draconian makes three Rend or Energy Ray attacks.

**Rend.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d12 + 2}) slashing damage.

**Energy Ray.** {@atk rs} {@hit 6} to hit, range 60 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d10 + 3}) force damage.

**Noxious Breath {@recharge 5}.** The draconian exhales a 15-foot cone of noxious gas. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 21 ({@damage 6d6}) poison damage and gains 1 level of {@condition exhaustion}. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, doesn't gain {@condition exhaustion}, and is immune to all draconians' Noxious Breath for 24 hours.
