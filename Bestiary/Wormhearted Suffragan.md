**Multiattack.** The wormhearted suffragan makes two Worm-Coated Fist or Paralyzing Bolt attacks.

**Worm-Coated Fist.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) bludgeoning damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. Until the disease is cured, the target can't regain hp, and its hp maximum decreases by 7 ({@dice 2d6}) every 24 hours. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.

**Paralyzing Bolt.** {@atk rs} {@hit 6} to hit, range 60 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 4d6 + 3}) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition paralyzed} until the end of its next turn.

**Animating Worms (3/Day).** The wormhearted suffragan touches the body of a dead Humanoid, passing on some of the suffragan's worms. The worms fill the target, animating it as a skeleton or zombie (the suffragan's choice) under the suffragan's control.
