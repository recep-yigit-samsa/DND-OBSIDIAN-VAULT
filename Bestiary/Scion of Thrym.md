**Multiattack.** The scion makes one Ice Axe and two Slam attacks, or it makes two Glacier Throw attacks.

**Ice Axe.** {@atk mw} {@hit 17} to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. {@h}36 ({@damage 4d12 + 10}) force damage plus 18 ({@damage 4d8}) cold damage.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 17} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}32 ({@damage 4d10 + 10}) force damage.

**Glacier Throw.** {@atk rw} {@hit 17} to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. {@h}36 ({@damage 4d12 + 10}) bludgeoning damage plus 14 ({@damage 4d6}) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 25} Strength saving throw or have the {@condition prone} condition.

**Glacial Upheaval {@recharge 5}.** The scion digs its hands into the ground at a point it can see within 30 feet of itself and launches a magically conjured mass of ice into the air. Each creature other than the scion in a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must make a {@dc 25} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 36 ({@damage 8d8}) bludgeoning damage plus 19 ({@damage 3d12}) cold damage and is pushed vertically to the top of the cylinder, at which point the creature falls. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space outside the cylinder with no additional effects. At the start of the scion's next turn, a mass of ice plummets to the ground on a point the scion can see within 60 feet of the point the scion dug its hands into. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must succeed on a {@dc 25} Dexterity saving throw or take 18 ({@damage 4d8}) bludgeoning damage plus 18 ({@damage 4d8}) cold damage.
