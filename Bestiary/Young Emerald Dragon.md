**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d10 + 5}) piercing damage plus 3 ({@damage 1d6}) psychic damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d6 + 5}) slashing damage.

**Disorienting Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a wave of psychic dissonance in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 15} Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 31 ({@damage 9d6}) psychic damage, and until the end of its next turn, when the creature makes an attack roll or an ability check, it must roll a {@dice d6} and reduce the total by the number rolled. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage with no additional effects.
