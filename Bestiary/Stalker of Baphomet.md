**Multiattack.** The stalker makes two Glaive attacks or two Rock attacks.

**Glaive.** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 2d10 + 7}) slashing damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) force damage.

**Rock.** {@atk rw} {@hit 11} to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. {@h}23 ({@damage 3d10 + 7}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 19} Strength saving throw or have the {@condition prone} condition. After the stalker throws the rock, roll a {@dice d6}; on a roll of 3 or lower, the stalker has no more rocks to throw.

**Erupting Horns {@recharge 5}.** The stalker causes the earth to churn at a point on the ground it can see within 60 feet of itself. Six horn-shaped stones erupt in a 30-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that point and then crumble to dust. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 33 ({@damage 6d10}) piercing damage and is pushed up to 30 feet upward and then falls. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.
