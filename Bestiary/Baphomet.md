**Multiattack.** Baphomet makes three attacks: one with Heartcleaver, one with his bite, and one with his gore attack.

**Heartcleaver.** {@atk mw} {@hit 17} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}21 ({@damage 2d10 + 10}) slashing damage.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 17} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}19 ({@damage 2d8 + 10}) piercing damage.

**Gore.** {@atk mw} {@hit 17} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d6 + 10}) piercing damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of Baphomet's choice within 120 feet of him and aware of him must succeed on a {@dc 18} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. These later saves have disadvantage if Baphomet is within line of sight of the creature. If a creature succeeds on any of these saves or the effect ends on it, the creature is immune to Baphomet's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
