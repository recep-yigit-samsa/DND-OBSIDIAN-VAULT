**Wand of Magic Missiles.** While holding this wand, Vellynne can expend 1 or more of its 7 charges to cast the {@spell magic missile} spell from it. She can expend 1 charge to cast the 1st-level version of the spell. She can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge she expends.
