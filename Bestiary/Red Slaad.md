**Multiattack.** The slaad makes three Injecting Claw attacks.

**Injecting Claw.** {@atkr m} {@hit 6}, reach 10 ft. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) Piercing damage. If the target is a Humanoid not cursed by a slaad, it is subjected to the following effect. {@actSave con} {@dc 14}. {@actSaveFail} The target is cursed unawares, and a minuscule slaad egg is implanted in it. Removing the curse destroys the egg. Over {@dice 2d4 Ã— 10} days, the egg gestates. In the final 24 hours, the cursed target feels unwell; its {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} is halved, and it has {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on {@variantrule D20 Test|XPHB|D20 Tests}. At the end of this time, the egg turns into a Slaad Tadpole, which chews out of the host and kills it.
