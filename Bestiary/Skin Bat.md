| Bite | 1d4 + 3 + 1d4 + 3 | 10 | - |


**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d4 + 3}) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 10} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition paralyzed} until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target can't be {@condition paralyzed} in this way by the skin bat again for 24 hours. In addition, the skin bat attaches to the target. While attached, the skin bat can't attack, and at the start of each of the bat's turns, the target takes 5 ({@damage 1d4 + 3}) piercing damage. The attached bat moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the bat's movement. It can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the skin bat by succeeding on a {@dc 11} Strength check.
