**Crush.** {@atkr m} {@hit 5}, reach 5 ft. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) Bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches to the target. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature and the darkmantle had {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on the attack roll, it covers the target, which has the {@condition Blinded|XPHB} condition and is suffocating while the darkmantle is attached in this way. While attached to a target, the darkmantle can attack only the target but has {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on its attack rolls. Its {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} becomes 0, it can't benefit from any bonus to its {@variantrule Speed|XPHB}, and it moves with the target. A creature can take an action to try to detach the darkmantle from itself, doing so with a successful {@dc 13} Strength ({@skill Athletics|XPHB}) check. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself by using 5 feet of movement.

**Darkness Aura (1/Day).** Magical {@variantrule Darkness|XPHB} fills a 15-foot {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} originating from the darkmantle. This effect lasts while the darkmantle maintains {@status Concentration|XPHB} on it, up to 10 minutes. Darkvision can't penetrate this area, and no light can illuminate it.
