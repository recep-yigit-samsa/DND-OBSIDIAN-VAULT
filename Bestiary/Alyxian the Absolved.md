**Multiattack.** Alyxian makes two Spear attacks.

**Spear.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) piercing damage, or 8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) piercing damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) radiant damage.

**Force Wave (1/Day).** Alyxian strikes the ground, creating a burst of energy that ripples outward. Each creature he chooses within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on himself must succeed on a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw or take 35 ({@damage 10d6}) force damage and be knocked {@condition prone}. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked {@condition prone}.
