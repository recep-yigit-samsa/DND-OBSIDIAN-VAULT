**Multiattack.** The vegepygmy makes two attacks with its claws or two melee attacks with its spear.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d6 + 2}) slashing damage.

**Spear.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d6 + 2}) piercing damage, or 6 ({@damage 1d8 + 2}) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**Spores (1/Day).** A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vegepygmy. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area that isn't a plant must succeed on a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned}. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, a target takes 9 ({@damage 2d8}) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
