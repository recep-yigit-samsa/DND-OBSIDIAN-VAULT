**Divisive Chatter {@recharge 5}.** The ratatosk causes division and strife in up to four creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Charisma saving throw or be irritated for 1 minute.

The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
