**Stomp.** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d12 + 3}) force damage.

**Realize Nightmares {@recharge 4}.** The oneirovore manipulates the perception of nearby creatures, sending them into a panic. Creatures of the oneirovore's choice that it can see within 60 feet must make a {@dc 19} Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the {@condition charmed} condition, their vision distorted such that they view their allies as creatures of pure fear and hatred. While {@condition charmed}, a creature will use their actions to attack their allies with intent to kill. A {@condition charmed} creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each turn, ending the effect on a success.

**Warning Cry (1/Day).** The oneirovore lets out an earsplitting shriek, calling for infernal reinforcements. Creatures that are not Fiends that are within 120 feet of the oneirovore must make a {@dc 19} Constitution saving throw, taking 55 ({@damage 10d10}) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any lesser devils within a 1-mile-radius, centered on the oneirovore, are required by contract to come to its aid upon hearing its Warning Cry. Higher ranking devils may investigate if they desire, but the call holds no magical sway over them.
