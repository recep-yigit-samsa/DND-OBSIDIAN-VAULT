**Stingblade.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) slashing damage plus 5 ({@damage 2d4}) poison damage. If the faerie had advantage on the attack roll, the target takes an additional 3 ({@damage 1d6}) slashing damage.

**Theft of Nerves (1/Day).** The faerie unleashes a burst of mind-muddling magic in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a {@dc 12} Intelligence saving throw or have the {@condition frightened} condition for 1 minute. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
