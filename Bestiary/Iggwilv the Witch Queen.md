**Multiattack.** Iggwilv makes two Bewitching Bolt attacks.

**Bewitching Bolt.** {@atk ms,rs} {@hit 16} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. {@h}25 ({@damage 5d6 + 8}) lightning damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 22} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition charmed} by Iggwilv until the start of her next turn.

**Abyssal Rift {@recharge 5}.** Iggwilv opens a momentary Abyssal rift within 120 feet of her. The rift is a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 22} Constitution saving throw, taking 40 ({@damage 9d8}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, there is a 50 percent chance that 3 {@creature hezrou||hezrous} then appear in unoccupied spaces in the sphere. They act as Iggwilv's allies, take their turns immediately after hers, and can't summon other demons. They remain until they die or until Iggwilv dismisses them as an action.
