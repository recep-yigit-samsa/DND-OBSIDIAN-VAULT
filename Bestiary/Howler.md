**Multiattack.** The howler makes two bite attacks.

**Rending Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) piercing damage. If the target is {@condition frightened} it takes an additional 22 ({@damage 4d10}) psychic damage. This attack ignores damage resistance.

**Mind-Breaking Howl {@recharge}.** The howler emits a keening howl in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area that isn't {@condition deafened} must succeed on a {@dc 16} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} until the end of the howler's next turn. While a creature is {@condition frightened} in this way, its speed is halved, and it is {@condition incapacitated}. A target that successfully saves is immune to the Mind-Breaking Howl of all howlers for the next 24 hours.
