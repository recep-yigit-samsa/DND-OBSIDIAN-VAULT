**Contaminated Nectar.** The Hypnotic Eldritch Blossom targets one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a {@dc 10} Constitution saving throw or gain one {@adventure level of contamination|DoDk|12}.

**Hypnotic Pollen (recharges on a short or long rest).** The Hypnotic Eldritch Blossom releases a cloud of glittering pollen out to a radius of 30 feet. Creatures in the area must succeed on a {@dc 10} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition charmed} by the Hypnotic Eldritch Blossom for 1 minute. While {@condition charmed}, the creature is {@condition incapacitated} and must use all its movement on its turns to get as close to the Hypnotic Eldritch Blossom as possible. The effect ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
