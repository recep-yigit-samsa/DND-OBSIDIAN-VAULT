**Multiattack.** The fire starter makes two Havoc Hammer or Havoc Flask attacks.

**Havoc Hammer.** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d8 + 3}) bludgeoning damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) fire damage. If the target is a creature, magical flames cling to it, causing it to take 3 ({@damage 1d6}) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. Immediately after taking this damage on its turn, the target can make a {@dc 13} Dexterity saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

**Havoc Flask.** {@atk rw} {@hit 4} to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d12}) fire damage. If the target is a creature, magical flames cling to it, causing it to take 3 ({@damage 1d6}) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. Immediately after taking this damage on its turn, the target can make a {@dc 13} Dexterity saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. After the fire starter throws the flask, roll a {@dice d6}; on a 3 or lower, the fire starter has no more flasks to throw.
