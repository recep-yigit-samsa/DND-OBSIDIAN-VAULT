**Multiattack.** The devilbound gnome makes three Hellish Blast attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

**Hellish Blast.** {@atk ms,rs} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) fire damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) poison damage.

**Hell's Servitors (1/Day).** The devilbound gnome magically calls {@dice 1d4} devils with a challenge rating of 4 or lower, or it calls 1 devil with a challenge rating of 6 or lower. The called Fiends arrive in {@dice 1d4} rounds, acting as allies of the gnome and obeying its spoken commands. The Fiends remain for 1 hour, until the gnome dies, or until the gnome dismisses them as a bonus action.

**To Hell and Back (1/Day).** The devilbound gnome sends one creature it can see within 60 feet of it hurling through Hell. The target must make a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the target takes 35 ({@damage 10d6}) fire damage as Hell pulls on the creature. On a failure, the target is {@condition incapacitated} and disappears, as it takes a quick trip through the nightmarish landscapes of Hell. At the end of the gnome's next turn, the target reappears in the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space, and takes 55 ({@damage 10d10}) psychic damage.
