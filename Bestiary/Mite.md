**Dagger.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}4 ({@damage 1d4 + 2}) piercing damage.

**Blood Boiling Hex {@recharge}.** The mite places a hex on a creature it can see within 60 feet of it for 1 minute. If the mite is hidden, using this ability does not reveal its location. While the creature is affected by this hex, whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, it must roll a {@dice d6} and subtract the number rolled from the {@dice d20} roll. On any turn in which it suffers the effect of the hex, the target can attack an ally as a reaction, ignoring the effect of the hex when it does so. It can then ignore the effect of the hex until the end of its turn.
