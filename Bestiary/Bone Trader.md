**Bone Club.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d8 + 2}) bludgeoning damage.

**Skelesuck.** {@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}4 ({@damage 1d4 + 2}) piercing damage. The target must succeed on a {@dc 10} Constitution saving throw or have one of its bones sucked out, resulting in the piercing damage becoming a reduction in maximum hit points until magical healing is applied.

**Fey Charm.** The bone trader targets one humanoid, goblinoid, fey, or beast it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or be magically {@condition charmed}. The {@condition charmed} creature regards the bone trader as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the bone trader's control, it takes the bone trader's requests or actions in the most favorable way . Each time the bone trader or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the bone trader dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the bone trader's fey charm for the next 24 hours. The bone trader can have no more than one humanoid {@condition charmed} at a time, along with up to three beasts.
