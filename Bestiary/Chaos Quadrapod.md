**Multiattack.** The chaos quadrapod makes up to two tentacle attacks.

**Tentacle.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 14}). Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained}. The chaos quadrapod can grapple no more than two targets at a time.

**Chaos Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The chaos quadrapod shoots forth a knot of roiling ethereal light that explodes at a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must succeed on a {@dc 14} Charisma saving throw or be {@condition stunned} until the end of its next turn.
