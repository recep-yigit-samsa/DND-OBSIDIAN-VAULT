**Nightmare Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a cloud of spores in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 11} Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 ({@damage 1d10}) psychic damage, and it is {@condition frightened} of the dragon for 1 minute.

A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
