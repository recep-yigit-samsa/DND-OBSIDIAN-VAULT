**Multiattack.** The doppelganger makes two melee attacks.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) bludgeoning damage.

**Read Thoughts.** The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 feet of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's {@status concentration} isn't broken (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) and Charisma ({@skill Deception}, {@skill Intimidation}, and {@skill Persuasion}) checks against the target.
