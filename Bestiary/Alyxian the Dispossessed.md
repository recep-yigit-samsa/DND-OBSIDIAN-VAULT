**Multiattack.** Alyxian makes two Spear attacks.

**Spear.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) piercing damage, or 8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) piercing damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) radiant damage.

**Stoneheart Dagger.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 3d4 + 4}) force damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw or become {@condition petrified} as the dagger lodges itself in the target's body. While the dagger is lodged in the target, magic can't end the {@condition petrified} condition on it and Alyxian can't make Stoneheart Dagger attacks. A creature within reach of the {@condition petrified} target can use an action to try to remove the dagger, doing so with a successful {@dc 17} Strength check.
