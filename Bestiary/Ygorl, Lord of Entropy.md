**Multiattack.** Ygorl makes three attacks: two with its scythe, and one with its Entropic Touch.

**Scythe.** {@atk mw} {@hit 14} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. {@h}18 ({@damage 2d10 + 7}) slashing damage plus 19 ({@damage 3d12}) necrotic damage. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by this attack dies, with its body and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, exploding into a cloud of ash. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a {@spell wish} spell.

**Entropic Touch.** {@atk mw} {@hit 14} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d8 + 7}) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 22} Constitution saving throw or gain one level of {@condition exhaustion}.

**Summon Slaadi (1/Day).** Ygorl summons {@dice 1d4 + 1} {@creature death slaad||death slaadi}. A summoned slaad appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Ygorl, acts as an ally of Ygorl, and can't summon other slaadi. It remains for 1 minute, until it or Ygorl dies, or until Ygorl dismisses it as an action.

**Teleport.** Ygorl teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
