**Snare Trap (1/Day).** The scout deploys a Tiny mechanical trap on a solid surface within 5 feet of itself. The trap is hidden, requiring a successful {@dc 17} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to find. The trap lasts for 1 minute. Whenever an enemy enters a space within 10 feet of the trap or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a {@dc 16} Dexterity saving throw or take 21 ({@damage 6d6}) piercing damage and have the {@condition prone} condition. A creature makes this saving throw only once per turn.
