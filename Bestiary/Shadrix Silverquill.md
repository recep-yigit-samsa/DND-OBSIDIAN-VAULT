**Multiattack.** Shadrix makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} {@hit 14} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 1d10 + 7}) piercing damage plus 4 ({@damage 1d8}) radiant damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} {@hit 14} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 1d6 + 7}) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it is wracked with despair and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn.

**Illuminating Shadow Breath {@recharge 5}.** Shadrix exhales an entwined burst of blinding radiance and unnerving shadow in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 21} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 31 ({@damage 7d8}) radiant damage and 31 ({@damage 7d8}) psychic damage and is {@condition blinded} until the start of Shadrix's next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition blinded}.
