**Multiattack.** The dragon makes three Rend attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of (A) Spellcasting to cast {@spell Guiding Bolt|XPHB} (level 2 version) or (B) Weakening Breath.

**Rend.** {@atkr m} {@hit 14}, reach 10 ft. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d8 + 8}) Slashing damage plus 4 ({@damage 1d8}) Fire damage.

**Fire Breath {@recharge 5}.** {@actSave dex} {@dc 21}, each creature in a 60-foot {@variantrule Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cone}. {@actSaveFail} 66 ({@damage 12d10}) Fire damage. {@actSaveSuccess} Half damage.

**Weakening Breath.** {@actSave str} {@dc 21}, each creature that isn't currently affected by this breath in a 60-foot {@variantrule Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cone}. {@actSaveFail} The target has {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on Strength-based {@variantrule D20 Test|XPHB|D20 Tests} and subtracts 3 ({@dice 1d6}) from its damage rolls. It repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.
