**Multiattack.** The Goose Mother makes as many Beak attacks as it has heads and one Wing attack.

**Beak.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) bludgeoning damage.

**Wing.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 1d12 + 3}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 15} Strength saving throw or have the {@condition prone} condition.

**Lullaby of Honks {@recharge 5}.** The Goose Mother's heads honk a discordant lullaby. Each creature of the Goose Mother's choice within 10 feet of it must make a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7 ({@damage 2d6}) thunder damage and falls into a magical slumber. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. The honks can be heard up to 300 feet away. A creature under magical slumber has the {@condition unconscious} condition for 8 hours. This effect ends early for a creature if it takes damage or another creature uses an action to shake it awake.
