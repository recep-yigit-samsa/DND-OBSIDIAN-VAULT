**Multiattack.** Yan-C-Bin makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} {@hit 14} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 3d8 + 7}) force damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) lightning damage.

**Thundercrack (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** Yan-C-Bin unleashes a terrible thundercrack in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on himself. All other creatures in the area must succeed on a {@dc 24} Constitution saving throw or take 31 ({@damage 9d6}) thunder damage and be {@condition deafened} for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is {@condition deafened} until the start of Yan-C-Bin's next turn.

**Change Shape.** Yan-C-Bin polymorphs into a Medium humanoid. While in polymorphed form, a swirling breeze surrounds him, his eyes are pale and cloudy, and he loses the Air Form trait. He can remain in polymorphed form for up to 1 hour. Reverting to his true form requires an action.

**Summon Elementals (1/Day).** Yan-C-Bin summons up to three {@creature air elemental||air elementals} and loses 30 hit points for each elemental he summons. Summoned elementals have maximum hit points, appear within 100 feet of Yan-C-Bin, and disappear if Yan-C-Bin is reduced to 0 hit points.
