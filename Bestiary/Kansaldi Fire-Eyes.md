**Multiattack.** Kansaldi makes two Pike attacks and uses Flame Burst.

**Pike.** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 1d10 + 4}) piercing damage plus 16 ({@damage 3d10}) radiant damage.

**Flame Burst.** Kansaldi hurls magical flames at a creature she can see within 60 feet of herself. The target must make a {@dc 16} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 11 ({@damage 2d10}) fire damage and catches fire; until a creature takes an action to put out the fire, the target takes 5 ({@damage 1d10}) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't catch fire.
