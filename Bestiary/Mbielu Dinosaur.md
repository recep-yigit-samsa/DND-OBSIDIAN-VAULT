| Ability | Damage | Save DC & Type | On Successful Save |

| Tail | 3d10 + 4 + 1d4 | 13 | - |
| Rumbling Bellow {@recharge 5} | 4d8 | 13 | - |


**Tail.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 3d10 + 4}) bludgeoning damage plus 2 ({@damage 1d4}) poison damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 13} Strength saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}.

**Rumbling Bellow {@recharge 5}.** The mbielu releases a deep bellow that vibrates within the bodies of those nearby. Each creature within 15 feet of the mbielu must make a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw, taking 18 ({@damage 4d8}) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature {@condition poisoned} by the mbielu's Toxic Skin fails this saving throw, it is also {@condition incapacitated} until the end of its next turn as the combined vibrations and hallucinations disorient it.
