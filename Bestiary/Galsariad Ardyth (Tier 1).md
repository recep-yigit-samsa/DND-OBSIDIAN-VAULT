**Gravity Wave {@recharge 5}.** Galsariad causes a rippling wave of magical gravity to fill a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point he can see within 120 feet of himself. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 13} Strength saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 17 ({@damage 5d6}) force damage and is pulled up to 10 feet toward the sphere's center. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.
