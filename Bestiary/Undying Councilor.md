**Multiattack.** The councilor makes two Radiant Touch attacks.

**Radiant Touch.** {@atk ms} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 3d6 + 5}) radiant damage.

**Healing Touch (3/Day).** The councilor touches another creature. The target magically regains 18 ({@dice 3d8 + 5}) hit points and is freed from one curse afflicting it (councilor's choice).

**Flame Strike (5th-Level Spell; Requires a Spell Slot).** The councilor chooses a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must make a {@dc 17} Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 14 ({@damage 4d6}) fire damage and 14 ({@damage 4d6}) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the councilor casts this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (its choice) increases by {@dice 1d6} for each slot level above 5th.
