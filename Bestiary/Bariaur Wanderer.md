**Multiattack.** The bariaur makes two Barbed Javelin or Shortbow attacks.

**Barbed Javelin.** {@atk mw,rw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 1d10 + 4}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of the bariaur's next turn.

**Ram.** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage. If the bariaur moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target takes an extra 10 ({@damage 3d6}) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Strength saving throw or have the {@condition prone} condition.

**Shortbow.** {@atk rw} {@hit 4} to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d6 + 2}) piercing damage, plus 4 ({@damage 1d8}) piercing damage if the target doesn't have all its hit points.
