**Multiattack.** Strahd makes two Death Strike attacks. He can replace one of these attacks with Blighted Fire if available.

**Death Strike.** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d8 + 4}) slashing damage plus 14 ({@damage 4d6}) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, Strahd can forgo dealing slashing damage; the target then has the {@condition grappled} condition (escape {@dc 18}) instead. Strahd can grapple only one creature at a time.

**Blighted Fire {@recharge 5}.** Strahd summons shadowy, necrotic fire that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point he can see within 90 feet of himself. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 ({@damage 4d6}) fire damage plus 14 ({@damage 4d6}) necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Charm.** Strahd targets one Humanoid he can see within 30 feet of himself. The target must succeed on a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw or have the {@condition charmed} condition. The {@condition charmed} target regards Strahd as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. The target isn't under Strahd's control, but it takes Strahd's requests and actions in the most favorable way. Each time Strahd or his companions deal damage to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Strahd is reduced to 0 hit points, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or uses a bonus action to end the effect.
